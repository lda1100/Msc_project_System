I ve played games since the 90 s and no other game gave me such a great emotional rollercoaster ride as RDR2 It s not just a game it s a 10 season western HBO show that you interact and engage with
Don t buy for multi player
Buy for single player
the balls on your horse shrink in the winter
This game teach us something very important Its never too late to be a good person and you can always seek for redemption Its perfect in every single way one of the best for sure I love you Arthur Morgan
I am old and in the way but i have been waiting for a GREAT western mmo for years and years it sems that now it is here At 70 yrs old i prolly played pc games for more years than I have left to play but until another GREAT western saga gets released I will be founs on this one Only complaint I have is that they asked you to name your character and then they use your user name for social club DUMB CRAP you characters name that you proplly put alot of time into kaming up appears NOWHERE so my char Lupo LaRaza is now named whispersxx Stupid crap NE WAY if that is my only complaint i have to give RDR2 a big THUMB up
There are stories good stories and then there are those stories you ll remember for a long time This game has it all Adventure tons of things to do a marvelous story fun gameplay and most of all it leaves you something You really care for the characters the gang family becomes like your family and when things go bad you really want to help Of course in the meantime you can hunt rob kill and do whatever nasty or good thing you prefer but you know someone is waiting for you And the ending will bring tears to your eyes for different things in multiple occasions Add to this an incredible very realistic environment a perfect western setting that would make Sergio Leone proud and you have an absolute masterpiece Oh i really wish Red Dead Redemption 1 were on Steam too maybe with some patience Just go and get it
FOR PEOPLE BEING TOLD TO RE PURCHASE THE GAME
Since Steam Support doesn t want to help any of us allow me Go to Steam settings Downloads Clear download cache
Then log in again and try to launch the game this worked for me Hope it works for you
This review is for the single player spent 150 hours to reach 91 completion and would need maybe 50 or 100 more hours to 100 it I didn t try the online yet i ll add the review for that after i try it
I wont review the story to avoid spoilers but it s a long game with some excellent missions as usual when it come to Rockstar games and the humor is spot on characters are great and the story as a whole is a great prequel to the excellent Red Dead Redemption
The game is not easy if you want to master everything nothing hard if you want to jump from one mission to another but it ll take you a bit of time to get familiar with all the activities that you can do especially the hunting which is essential if you want to craft the best items in the game
For the visuals even while not at the ultra settings this game is insanely beautiful i never felt a world full with life as much as in RDR2 Rockstar went into each detail to create the last days of the Wild West and it s a huge payoff for the players you really feel like you riding with a gang in the early 1900s And with photo mode whatever you are doing and wherever you are on the map be sure that you ll end up with a nice photo I ll add to that the dynamic weather and different environment that wont change just the looks but also the fauna and flora of the region
Shooting is pretty satisfying with the dead eye mechanic and the slow motion
Even the crafting is diverse from food to ammo to tonics also loved the weapon modifications to make each weapon customized to a different look
Map is pretty big for a game that uses a horse as the primary travelling method you can fast travel easily using camp train or stagecoach but i dont advise that you ll miss a lot of nice things like that a lot of random events Plus there is way too many things to collect that will take hours and hours to find them all add to that around 100 challenges and you have over 200 hours of gameplay without even touching the online part of the game and even with all that time i m sure that you ll miss a few of easter eggs or interesting places in this game
It s an amazing game and to me one of the best games ever made so it s highly recommended for anyone who have the patience to learn what this game have to offer
Thank you Rockstar for all the amazing moments i had playing this game
Edit I couldn t play online each 5 or 10 minutes i receive this error
You have been disconnected from Red Dead Online due to a fault on Rockstar game services Error 0x20010006
I m 50 long time gamer first time a game has been emotional for me It is just an epic experience to play I have had issues with crashing sound problems reboot fix annoying cursor showing switch to windowed and then back to full so it has been frustrating at times but generally runs pretty well and looks beautiful 1440p mostly ultra on Ryzen 3600 RTX2060
It will be a while sadly before I play its ilke again
What can I say that hasn t been said and that you don t know
The attention to detail is mind boggling the missions from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars
The single player campaign is one of the best adventures I ever went on in my life This is why I love games
The beauty of this game in indescribable It s one of most realistic living worlds I ve ever been in
In fact it felt so real to me that I would spend hours living and breathing the game I felt I was there at that time
Taking care of my horse spending time fishing and hunting sometimes for hours
Riding my horse in strong winds and heavy rain collecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all times
I got attached to people took care of them or dragged them behind my horse when I wasn t in the mood for their BS
I ve been there I lived there That was me I was a cowboy Nobody will convince me otherwise
Story is legendary Online is a scam
It was not a game it was an experience
Play for the single player
Months of life lost zero regrets
Arthur Morgan is one of the most beautifully written characters of all time
Obviously this game has been given countless amazing reviews all I have to add is that
I ve played 500 hours entirely solo and I m only now deciding I ve done enough as Arthur and it s time to go to the epilogue
This game offers the most game play of any single player game I ve ever played I haven t seen one anywhere near this class since Fallout New Vegas
Rockstar Games is known for setting benchmarks when it comes to their open world titles Red Dead Redemption 2 is their best work to date without a doubt Unquestionably beautiful vast and detailed It breathes life From the tiniest toad to the scary Grizzly bear everything feels alive and convincing It s an environment so well crafted that it makes you wonder whether it isn t a real world within your own computer Non playable characters have their own lives with a routine that they follow religiously just like we do Some do hard work some drink all day some mourn their loss es It s hard to believe it s just a video game I remember when Skyrim had something similar and people couldn t believe how insanely realistic it was Imagine that but twice as convincing That s RDR 2 for you They feel so alive that you feel bad for killing them with your plethora of period accurate weaponry
Evidently a game is not solely made of environment and their inherent goodies That s where the story mode comes in And as many of you may know by now either from YouTube or any of the media portals you routinely visit for the daily dose of gaming news it s a masterpiece Storytelling is not an easy craft but they have visibly dominated it after decades and decades of duly delivered benchmarks of how an open world game should be They make it seem easy almost as if anyone could do it Memorable characters insane character development just like we like it and then fantastic endings based on your own decisions As linear as it may be forcing you to do things their way rather than setting your imagination free and letting you decide how to approach a mission it still allows you to take certain decisions that will shape the moral values of your character therefore leading it to a specific outcome Games don t often get the whole moral debate right understandably so because they are empty characters with a pre recorded set of phrases and reactions that can t resonate with you But Arthur Morgan is different It s a rather captivating individual that feels real Real enough that you will often find yourself questioning whether to kill or spare someone or if you should or not help that person in need And inevitably feel the pain of uncertainty of the future or the lack thereof that lies ahead
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a western beyond all westerns An adventure you can dive in yourself and watch your character grow through all the hardships of the outlaw life A novel like main character that is a criminal killer cruel and savage but also a human being like all of us And humanity wins in the end Arthur learns what it is to be human and there is no better teacher than life itself
Would I recommend Red Dead Redemption 2 It would be a crime not to As flawed as it may be in certain aspects like the slightly truncated gameplay the typical Rockstar linearity and the underwhelming online mode the story is something out of this world It truly outstands Goes above and beyond the average video game storytelling It s something you ve got to experience to understand A must play for every gamer out there
If I wrote this review in the first 40 hours of its story it would be completely different from now after completing the 6th chapter 80 hours in the story
Oh dear This title will remain in my heart forever
the world is the most alive and coherent in ALL of open world games This is open world mastered and perfected by the best The very best on doing so You can spend an infinite amount of time in the world
The animals who live in this giant MASSIVE open world map are the stars of making it alive
Accordingly with Red Dead 2 wiki there is 38 animal species with lots of subspecies to spice it up You will find 170 different animals in this game
Currently hovering over 147 hours of having the game open on steam I have not seen everything this world has to offer yet It is a GIANT behemoth of a game
It is to die for My god it is a roller coaster and so well written in the human sense I have never connected to a protagonist as I have in this No game has ever made me tear up The soundtrack the voice acting the setting everything It is so well done
The most detailed world you can have in games Compare this to their own GTA Cyberpunk 2077 any other open world The amount of realism put into this is not of this world So many organic interactions with npcs the physics and with the nature makes this an intoxicating journey with great immersion
As usual it is not perfect The game suffers GREATLY from Ludonarrative dissonance Meanwhile in the story human life has a great weight you ll find yourself killing hundreds throughout the game and story when outside a cut scene It is very common in games and it is a shame because Arthur story is monumental it is very human
One other thing this game does amazingly and it is a shame that the current culture in gaming does not appreciate is the taste for a journey and not a pure min max that you focus solely on numbers and efficiency on whatever you are doing
This is what the game structure tries to teach but not in a obvious way When I purchased RED DEAD 2 early last year I gravitated to a min max state of mind later on the story around hour 40 and it made me annoyed for the animations length of travel punishing physics Sadly so because I was losing the point of it all
This month in 2021 I reinstalled it and jumped on the story and it clicked me
When you re skinning a hunt when you re taking care of your horse when you are in a shop or interacting in a saloon Everything is made methodically to be the most realistic possible and to tell a story
You ll find yourself out in the wilderness alone maybe passing 5 whole minutes crafting split point bullets that are free you make an X with your knife on a bullet s tip but it takes an animation All of this tells a story Time passes Sun rises sun sets
From the state of mind of enjoying the journey even more precious in these times we are living in I found myself enjoying 1000 more the game I stopped making my horse run for minutes straight from point A to point B and began enjoying the view while trotting and stopped riding when the view was just right to appreciate how gorgeous this game is
The views the animals the story the characters the world
Even with so many flaws this goes straight up to my favorites quite possibly number 1
This changed the way I think about life and the world even though it was in my heart before It refined further what I believed in No game has EVER done that to me
I recommend watching the many essays on youtube about red dead 2 including one from Real Pixels
just hope they don t ruin the online by adding a horse with jetpacks and heat seeking missiles
Please make story expansions for this game
After the long wait finally Rockstar fans can play one of the finest games this generation
Red Dead Redemption 2 for those with the hardware capable of running it is the best western gaming experience we could ever have hoped for
You forget what reality is
Don t look too long at
It s just gameplay
Watch paint dry instead

The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs
I played Red Dead 2 when it came out for PS4 back in 2018 and remember getting completely lost in it for a couple weeks I thought it was amazing and one of the best games ever made
I put it down after finishing it mainly due to getting burnt out and I didn t really touch it again for a couple years In 2020 I built my first proper gaming PC and after the miserable launch of Cyberpunk I thought I d buy this on sale 33 off and play through it again with hopefully better FPS
And my god did it blow me away Ok the first hour or so I spent tuning the settings and controls to make everything run optimally but once I got through all that I got lost in the world of Red Dead all over again Firstly the graphics are absolutely stunning I find myself having to stop my adventuring constantly to take photos of the landscape or an animal caught doing something cool Whether you re up in the snowy mountains or riding through the desert or dense lush forests everything feels incredibly genuine with the upheaval of snow or mud as you wade through and realistic water physics and immersive ecosystems Luckily I manage high ultra settings and maintain a solid 80 100 FPS except in busy towns where it can drop to 60ish a very rare treat for modern graphically demanding games
Gameplay wise Rockstar also knocked it out of the park Sure the gun fights could be a little easier for QoL but that s my one and only gripe with the mechanics and it s a minor irritation at its worst Some say that the survival and maintenance mechanics are tedious but I think it adds to that lone wanderer feel this game gives You re on your own most of the time with just your horse and I find myself taking pride in taking care of myself and my animal Aside from being alone you can stumble across a ton of random encounters all with a choice you can make and it just makes the world feel alive The towns and NPCs all feel alive and real offering jobs vending haircuts for that awesome real time hair and beard growth and much more And omg was it a breath of fresh air after Cyberpunk to see how intelligent the AI and crime systems are
Finally story wise I cannot fault it It s a masterpiece of writing and character development Arthur Morgan has become one of my favourite characters of all time not just in video games The rest of the gang all have their own personalities which adapt as the story progresses and you really come to fall in love with some of them Once I finished the epilogues I just wanted to erase my memory go back and do it all again
Overall RDR2 has become one of if not my favourite game of all time and now it s on PC I fully believe it to be the best video game ever made with Witcher 3 being a close second even though I prefer fantasy and RPG RDR2 just constantly has me in awe If you have a decent enough rig to run it well I highly recommend picking it up It s worth full price and more but if you re lucky you can get it for a steal in a sale
Forgot to mention the music score and all audio in general are also absolutely incredible
Singleplayer You already know how entertaining it is from other reviews well im not gonna say otherwise as well since it really is
Multiplayer Error code 0x20010006 You have been disconnected from Red Dead Online due to a fault on Rockstar game services
Let me start by saying the negative reviews are valid Rockstar bungled the release of this game I had to struggle with my settings to get the game working and its understandable that some may not want to go through this hassle when I game that matches your specs should just install and work
That being said once I got the game working it was a masterpiece This game has a story that choked me up at certain points but it still delivers on its promise horse ridin gun shootin cowboy action I would put this up with the original Bioshock as games that could be literature
The game was an extraordinary experience for me Particularly the Story Mode From the very beginning I was drawn right into the game It was like being in an interactive cinematic film You felt so involved it was one of the best fun I have had in quite a long time as far as how a game can leave a lasting impact
The graphics are beautiful and very picturesque The voice acting was brilliant and the cast was very believable While playing it I didn t want to leave and wanted to keep on playing because for me it was THAT good
Luckily I didn t have too many issues with crashes I got them a handful of times while playing through the Story Mode
The game comes with STEAM achievements too which gives you even more focus of activities to do in game as a challenge
The game also has an online side of it But the online as much as it was fun playing it with a good friend lacked content Understandably its still in early stages The Online has many many issues Lots of disconnections from session and I have run into some modders The infinite loading screens are a real nuisance that for months I have much difficulty joining into some games like Racing for example Some trade missions and Moonshiner missions will fail for no reason and you lose your stock The infinite loading screen will not load the mission resulting in many RE LAUNCHING THE GAME The camp setup is so glitchy that most of the time you cannot get the camp to spawn
Overall for the story mode I will give this game a 9 5 10
The Graphics I will give it a 9 10
Music I will rate it as an 8 10
Cast Characters in the game a 8 5 10
Realism like Hunting skinning animals etc I will give that a 7 10 for the animation cutscene
Online Mode is a bit more tricky to give a rating though its packed with lots of fun aspects it is very broken with so many issues for example the many disconnections glitches infinite loading screens modders in some sessions forcing you to relaunch to change your session due to infinite loading screen preventing you to switch while already in game However the Online aspect for me personally is simply a BONUS to an awesome single player game This rating can change if and when Rockstar Games fixes the problems the game is currently experiencing in Online Mode
Note Story Missions in Online Mode were fun to do as well as the Bounty Hunter jobs Hunting animals for Trader Business crafting cooking treasure hunting Collector Business mini activities when working were stacks of fun and the fishing was realistic and enjoyable also So in saying that I will give these a 6 0 10
This is a story a collection of stories really about the decline of a way of life as a small gang of outlaws tries ever harder to outrun the inexorable advance of American modernity as well as the enemies and lawmen they have antagonised along the way
Great Gameplay Satisfying and Enjoyable
Story that can hit you in the heart
Great Soundtracks
Realistic graphics Beautiful visuals
Side quests Stranger missions
In my humble opinion yes
Story mode is amazing but online is horrible
Anyways after completing this game i can safely say that being a mango farmer in Tahiti is sure good and honest work Nothing of it would be possible without our great leader Dutch

Rockstar Games put their heart and soul in developing this game One of the most beautiful and most detailed game ever made
only downside is that you cant leave micah to rot in prison
grandpa used to love westerns
Arthur Morgan looks like my grandpa
wish my grandpa could play this
I lost 10 in a game of poker and i just got up and killed everyone at the table and got my money back Makes poker fun when i know iam never gonna lose my money heh
Playing this on a GTX 1060 6gb i7 6700 non K 16gb 3600mhz ddr4 RAM and I have it installed on a Samsung Evo 860 500GB SSD Most settings medium Texture detail volumetric fog to ultra and TXAA turned on Avarage 45 FPS at 1080p
The game looks gorgeous Voice acting is top notch the world is incredibly detailed and polished and everything just feels alive This will get buried underneath all the other reviews so I ll stop it here and just recommend it
In the 120 hours it took me to finish the game I didn t use the fast travel even once The world is beautifully crafted there s so much attention to detail and its so full of life that I feared I ll miss something if I d use it
Riding fishing hunting just exploring this world can take so many hours of fun I never enjoyed riding and exploring so much like in this game Witcher 3 comes close in that regard but the world in RDR2 feels way more alive
There s always something going on and you re not solely a spectator you re part of it People travelling and camping bandits robbing a wagon or kidnapping someone hunters mauled by predators fishermans animals lurking in the woods wild horses running in open praires
Whole ecosystems with a fidelity in their representation that is really impressive from the damp swamps of Lemoyne to the cold mountains of the Grizzlies breathtaking sights in each and every one of these lands
The towns and cities follow the same design quality as the rest of the game extremely detailed with their own routines people coming and going living their life Saint Denis might be one of the most beautiful and detailed cities I ever saw in a game the moment you step on it you ll understand what I mean
The physics engine that made IV the ultimate GTA experience for me at least has come back to bring this game to life Simply shooting at someone can have so many different outcomes it never feels like you re watching the same animation over and over
Enemies will fall off the horse to get trampled to death they will get tangled in the stirrups their corpses getting dragged until the horse calms down eventually falling dead on the ground They ll get shot down like a sack of potatoes from the impact of a shotgun face blown out in half And more
The way animals move interact with each other get wounded and slowly die when you hunt them how it feels to fall from your horse or crash into a wagon every single one of these things has a weight of its own is not just a couple of ragdolls colliding with each other without a sense of impact it feels genuine
The chase sequences shootouts robbing trains and stores shooting up a gang hideout bounty hunting I really enjoyed all of the different activities there s not a lack of things to do and action is a plenty Every one of these is fun to play and feel different each time thanks to the physics engine and its unique interactions
Although I would ve loved to see some more guns there s quite a good amount but they all seem pretty similar to one another in how they feel Once you ve used a repeater rifle you used them all Same with shotguns and revolvers
The only guns that really differentiate from other categories where the semi auto pistols which were also way too powerful when used in dead eye mode
I did not experience a single frame rate drop or a crash to desktop in the entirety of my 120 hours playthrough Not Even Once
Bear in mind I m playing on a fairly decent setup so your results may vary but the consistency of the frame rate was really impressive considering the scope of the game and how good it looks
I only experienced a half a second freeze stutter sometimes when entering Saint Denis as if the game was loading the city but it happened only when entering for the first time of each game session and no more after that
And something that I hate about open world games which is texture grass or NPC pop in is not present in this game at all That was another technical aspect that really impressed me
Other Rockstar games Kingdom Come Skyrim you name it almost every open world game has some degree of pop in issues sometimes is subtle other times is unbereable KCD I m looking at you well Red Dead Redemption 2 got rid of that completely
That s commendable it looks wonderful runs smooth and doesn t suffer from common technical issues other games do even games with much more smaller and less detailed worlds than this one
Some stuff that could ve been better Rockstar needs to address their mission design which feels a bit outdated linear it doesn t cut it anymore Sometimes it holds on your hand too much to the point of feeling that it treats you as an idiot who would get lost if a big prompt isn t telling you what to do next every 5 minutes
The honour system doesn t make much sense You get penalized for petty stuff like looting a corpse on the side of the road starting a fight with a person who threatens you and even if they start shooting at you or accepting a reward after saving someone from a wild animal or a robbery
Some side missions often show another side of Arthur who s a good hearted fellow someone who despite being a bandit still retains some humanity He s clearly not a murdering sociopath like some of the fellers he hangs around with
But then you go into another mission that have you go beat the sh1t out of a working man just because he cannot repay a debt or steal money from innocent people then kill half a town to escape Doesn t make any sense to me
It doesn t matter how you play outside of missions it won t change anything if you want to be good you ll still be dragged to do stupid stuff and kill people for no reason other than we re outlaws and I have a plan just blindly follow and trust me dont ask any questions
The pacing of the story feels weird it tries to give a sense of urgency but then it drags you doing errands and stuff that takes time and isn t really important nor urgent Also I would ve loved to see what happened in Blackwater since its the main reason the band is on the run but you never really know what happened you only get told that something went really bad and we had to leave
A first mission similar to the GTA V bank robbery where you could play what happened in Blackwater to experience first hand the event that actually kickstarted the whole story would ve been a much better introduction to the game than the rather confusing one we got
But despite all that the overall quality of the game was enough to outshine any negative aspects of it in my experience This is truly a gem of a gem worth a try even of you don t like open world games much or just don t like games from Rockstar in general
Give this one a chance you won t regret it
This review refers to the offline single player mode
Standalone prequel story for the 1st RDR
Various mods around to alter the gameplay
My highest game rating since The Witcher 3
Without a doubt my personal PC GOTY 19
The best non fantasy game story I ve seen
Single 1440p 90 Ultra 144 FPS FreeSync
Cloned 1440p 80 Ultra locked at 60 FPS
Windows 10 Professsional 64 bit
AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12 x 3 80 GHz
Asus RX 5700 XT 8 GB GDDR6 PCIe 4 0
32 GB DDR4 3200 RAM NVMe M 2 SSD
Microsoft Xbox One and PS4 controller s
So currently in Germany it is winter and actually it quite heats up my room pretty good
In only one hour my room temperature went from 19 degrees celsius to 24 degrees celsius
I recommend this game if you don t have a heater at home and wanna heat up your room
BEST GAME I HAVE PLAYED IN 10 YEARS
Old gamer here 30 years of gaming 20 on steam 15 on this account alone
Played hundreds of games if not thousands blah blah
Owned about 15 consoles and as many PCs over the years I love all style I ve seen it all blah blah
I will say something I never thought I d say nowadays with all the terrible games that come out these years I mostly talk about gameplay after while it s pretty much the only thing that interests you annoying old man mode off
I say a decade but this is most probably the best game I ve played since TES III Morrowind and that was 18 years ago
The game has it all It s gorgeous well written well animated the quests and side quests are all polished and interesing The attention to detail is astonishing and the lasting appeal is phenomenal
This is not only one of these games that establish a bridge between the video game media and the cinematic world think of it like a 80 hour long interactive tarantino movie but it is also the best of them in my humble opinion
I bought the game around the time Cyberpunk 2077 was released I really wanted this game to be my favourite game the setting the developper the possibilities exactly what I wanted
Result Played RDR2 around 20 hours then came Cyberpunk Played Cyberpunk for about 15 20 hours across 4 or 5 play sessions I was forcing myself to go back to it
After a while I gave up entirely and went back to RD2 No regret Best AAA game I ve seen in years
BTW I work as a professional pilot and I don t have much time to play nowadays What I really want from a game is to escape and relax for a couple hours here and there
With RDR2 I feel like i m teleported to early 20th century south western USA in a blink
My name is Arthur for a couple hours I ride my horse contemplate the beauty of the appalaches hunt the bounty I picked at the local sheriff office blow his hand in a gun duel hogtie him to the back of my horse stop by the river on the way back to do a little sunset fishing while my prisoner insults me in the background Drop him in jail collect the bounty go back to Valentine to rest at the hotel take a bath in good company play a couple rounds of poker punch a drunk on the thoroughfare on the way back to the hotel And go back to sleep End of play session 2 hours well spent
So after 90 hours on this game and completing all the 6 Chapters and 2 Epilogue 90 overall in the single player mode it s a Masterpiece Perhaps the greatest video game I have played a game everyone should play
This game has one of the best stories ever made Oscar worthy voice acting a soundtrack you could listen to over and over an open world that feels alive but wants you dead characters you wish you could confide in and cuddle graphics that have truly set the bar for open world games only if you have some GAMING MONSTER and an experience you will never forget like never And those tiny mind blowing details in these game is beyond expectation Once again Rockstar games manage to outdo themselves
You can easily sink 100 s of hours in this huge experience exploring the vast beautiful world of the west in the early 1900s There s so much to do that s just the single player experience 3
just buy it Its worth every penny I give this game 10 10
Despite a terrible launch on PC i won t judge this masterpiece on that that would be stupid
This is the greatest game I have ever played
It has the most immersive open world godlike graphics art direction the most lifelike physics engine ever made thank you Euphoria exquisite music and attention to detail and that is all true but I want to draw the attention to what really makes this game special its connection to Red Dead Redemption 1
Most game sequels of this calibre completely neglect their previously established characters and story because they don t have the confidence to try and build on them in case they flop and just make everyone hate their previous work as well but Red Dead Redemption 2 is different It actually HAS that confidence And it delivers This is the greatest video game narrative ever written The choice to make it a prequel and tie it back to John Marston s old days in the Dutch Van Der Linde Gang is hands down the BEST aspect of this game It harkens back to characters you love so you instantly have that connection and uses that context to establish new characters you ll know and love as well Arthur Morgan s struggle with morality and the inevitable outcome of his actions is one of the most engaging gaming stories ever told and is a great successor to John Marston s story which was also brilliant
My 90 year old grandma could play it
Graphics dont matter in this game
This game has no story
Like playing Temple Runners for the story
It s there for the people who want it
In terms of bang for your buck it s well worth the money even at 60 In fact games like Red Dead Redemption 2 make the argument that games could be a lot more expensive and justify the price simply due to the sheer amount of content it has
2 Can you play Red Dead Redemption offline
That s right you can t play even the story mode of Red Dead Redemption 2 if you re not online The game uses the Rockstar Game Launcher no matter where you ve purchase the game from And if you launch the game without being connected to the internet you ll be told you don t have the rights to play it For now can t be fixed maybe it will be like that forever
3 How Long Does Red Dead Redemption 2 take to beat
Most estimates put the game s length at about 40 to 60 hours with HowLongtoBeat reporting an aggregated length of 47 5 hours in simply completing the main campaign If you decide to complete the game s side quests that will add about 30 hours to the game
4 Is RDR2 a hard game
It won t be very hard as far as game play goes Play on easy You don t really even need to aim if that s what you re worried about
5 How old is Arthur Morgan
marry me arthur morgan
edit i would add john too but hes married and im anything but a homewrecker
edit 2 no but seriously this is the best game ive ever played in my life it is worth every penny
First of all English is not my native language but for practice I m going to write this review in this lovely language sorry if you see any mistakes
I ll try to don t ramble too much even if it s going to be difficult but this game has a lot to talk Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the best game I ve played in a long time even one of the best I ve ever played in my short life It s not perfect it has faults but it s a really good experience
I think Rockstar is the best making open worlds or at least making worlds that feel alive not just look nice The world is full of details you are able to do a lot of things like hunting and fishing and those tasks feel really well made even if I personally think fishing is boring like look a brick this accompanied by a technique section really impressive the textures animations lights smoke sand and fog among others just look gorgeous and help the world looks much better There are landscapes really beautiful out there getting lost in the forest dessert mountains contemplating the nature is a delightful even the city of Saint Denis in its industrial apogee it s beautiful the light effects and fog at night are simply speechless The animation of animals people everything help to feel that world alive Unfortunately I can pin one of the problems of the game here the game is poorly optimized Even if I have the recommended requirements and more I can t make the game works at a stable 60 fps I don t feel many fps drops and it s totally playable some graphics option simply doesn t work or work badly If you have a system that has problems with the minimum requirements I m not sure if you are going to be able to enjoy properly the game
The Story I think this is the best writing game of Rockstar so far it s not excellent but really good maybe a bit rushed in the development of the game I say that because there are many part of the world that you don t see or experiment with Arthur It shows a cruel and beautiful world of the pre 19th century Arthur is such a good protagonist his develop of character is personally one of the best things of the game He changes like the world around him but he is not alone the other characters in the gang are so good writing other better than other but you can make a good feeling with those people Even the secondary characters are good wrote those you find in secondaries quest or strangers out there There are decisions in the game but don t change so much at the end even if there are 4 different finals available
The gameplay is good it feels good the game is full of options weapons and stuff the missions are the big point but like a good video that I saw on youtube it seems like Rockstars always wants to take you by the hand nothing of improvising we don t do that thing here don t misinterpret me the missions are super fun but maybe a bit of player control can help to be more fun I feel curious about some control riding the horse I m not sure if it is a bug or just a realistic mechanic it s annoying though when suddenly the horse run in circles
Now I ll talk a bit about the online if you are going to buy this game thinking this is a Western GTA online yeah it s something like that but nope I played some hours it s fun with friends I personally don t like the pvp component I think the pve is more fun but that s my opinion The online feels a bit empty there are things to do but not much also there are many cheaters modders than it seems Rockstar don t care a bit The Strongpoint in this game is the campaign that s all
In synthesis or something like that RDR2 is in my opinion the best Western open world over there it s has a delightful world an adult cruel and sad well made story and an online not so good but fun with a lack of content I hope Rockstar bet more games like this one Thank you
Red Dead Redemption 2 RDR2 is one of Rockstar s best games ever It vastly improves upon the first game and has the quality you expect from a Rockstar game and AAA games in general
Red Dead 2 s greatest strengths is its story and voice acting along with the very strong world that always feels alive bustling and immersive This is complemented by its deep and solid gameplay along with a vast amount of customization in the game that you can use to make the playthrough unique to you
The gameplay in RDR2 is fantastic While some argue that it s too realistic and tedious it didn t bother me at all In fact I like the gameplay s realism a lot I liked pulling guns off your horse looting dead bodies by digging their pockets individually having to feed yourself and your horse to keep your cores filled up and more It s a nice change of pace that fits the gloomy western atmosphere really well
Controls can be a bit overwhelming at first but you can get a grasp of them fairly quickly Sometimes you do stuff you don t want to do by accident if you are not careful I played through the game with controller just because I always find open world Rockstar games to be easier with controller but the game is definitely playable on keyboard and mouse Besides the horse riding requiring too much button tapping I didn t have many complaints with the controls All keyboard controls are re bindable which is a great touch
There is a lot of ways to get money from honorable ways like bounty hunting to dishonorable ways like train robberies Once you get all this cash there is a lot of stuff to spend it on There is a lot of clothing items guns horses accessories for those horses food and drinks at the general store and more One big complaint I have to mention is that some guns are locked off until you unlock them in the story which is annoying You can be flush with cash but cannot spend it on new guns simply because you have not gotten to that part of the story which is a goofy game design choice
You can also make Arthur yours by how you play the game Included in the game is an honor system that will rise or fall depending on your choices in the game Depending on your honor you will talk to people differently and people will react to your presence positively or negatively I always played Arthur with high honor but he can definitely work as a low honor character too and I am considering a low honor playthrough soon
The story of Red Dead 2 is based around the Van der Linde gang running across the American frontier from government agents and lawman after a failed heist in Blackwater The gang s relationship gets more strained as the law gets closer and closer to wiping the gang out and this all happens in a world where the wild west era is getting swept by the oil refineries and cities I personally loved the story from start to finish and the setting it is based in complements the story The story is written very well and always has you on the edge of your seat It s worth noting that RDR 2 is actually a prequel to the first game The idea of making this game a prequel to RDR was pretty smart as it sets up for the events of the first game and makes the story of the first game that much more high stakes
Arthur Morgan the game s protagonist is a joy to play as for the lengthy story The other significant characters such as Dutch John and Sadie are all well written Dutch in particular has probably the best character development out of everyone in the game as he leads the gang on the run from the law and starts to go more insane as the game progresses It s also great to go out and do missions with various members of your gang as you can bond with them and see how they work and react with Arthur I didn t have anyone in the game that I did not like when I saw them besides the antagonists of course
This game is absolutely beautiful with some of the best graphics I ve seen yet in any video game The tradeoff is that RDR2 can be pretty taxing on your system On my system I ran the game at 1440p with a mix of Medium High settings and only managed to pull about 40 50 FPS Seeing as I played through the game on Xbox One at 30 FPS I wasn t too annoyed about this I preferred to see the game at its beauty in 1440p and with it being so demanding I just embraced the low FPS to experience the game at such a high graphical fidelity
The game is not bug glitch free as is typical from open world games of this caliber I ran into a few odd quirks and bugs including a few softlocks and one game crash One softlock included Arthur getting locked in place after getting out of bed The other softlock was due to the crash mentioned earlier which actually corrupted about 30 GBs of game files I m assuming the game didn t know what to do when trying to access corrupted game files so it would lock up every time I would start a story mission It was very annoying using up internet on my data cap redownloading game files to get my game working again People have also reported issues with the Rockstar Launcher but I never ran into any problems with it personally although it is an inconvenience to have two layers of DRM keeping me from playing my 60 game
As of this review the standard edition of RDR2 is priced at 59 99 with subsequent editions of this game being 79 99 and 99 99 with each edition adding small cosmetic DLC and Red Dead Online bonuses
In my opinion the game is worth it even at 99 The amount of content on offer is mindblowing complemented by very good writing and a lengthy story Red Dead Online RDO is an extra to me compared to the singleplayer content
Speaking of Red Dead Online it is included with the game for free but there are some sections of it locked off behind a paywall You can easily get past these paywalls if you shell out some money on the premium currency of RDO Gold Although you can earn gold in game via stranger missions it s extremely slow so I went ahead and shelled out money to buy access to all the Specialist roles which was about 20 While it does add a lot of extra content it was extra money I had to spend on top of the initial 52 I paid on the game Keep that in mind if you want to get into RDO
Despite any setbacks of this game it is worth every penny Rockstar created such a vast deep and beautiful game that is dripping with love and passion It has been worth the 50 hours I spent in the world so far I don t know where Rockstar is going to take Red Dead now but I m excited to see
this game is god but we live in iran and we cant speak english so if you take more money from us like dlc and add our languege in game this was be amazing and we can understand story line and enjoy more from game thanks for make this game you are amazing
i don t really know where to start or if anyone will read this but
I have never related to a character in a game so much when i was young being involved in motocycle gangs and pretty awful people to one day be diagnosed with Lymphoma a form of cancer and having my health be the reason to walk away from everything And having Arthur desperately try to do the same hurt me more as he tried to do good by the end
this was an amazing game by rockstar it was raw and full of emotion
if you havnt played this series its not to late to jump on board
I like the part with the Arthur guy
There are experiences in life that you cannot forget This is one of them
Story Soundtrack Graphics Characters Wild West
Red Dead Redemption 2 is an absolute masterclass in storytelling The sheer amount of dialogue and character building in this game is just incredible Everything from the graphics combat soundtrack mission design and writing are top notch and that s what makes Rockstar so special I ve never gotten so attached to a character as much as I did with Arthur Morgan he s one of the best video game protagonists ever There s just so much to see and do in this wonderful open world and it never gets old Also it is very well optimised and I never really had any issues with bugs or crashes
The only con for me was that the pacing got a bit slow and off direction about midway through the game but it does pick up soon after Also I felt that the game restricts player freedom and movement in some missions and camps which is a bit annoying Other than these the game is just near perfect If the huge campaign wasn t enough there s Red Dead Online too which has a lot of fun content to be had and is frequently updated Red Dead Redemption 2 is worth every single penny definitely recommended
Easily one of the greatest games of all time if you haven t played this before I highly recommend you buy this Its worth every penny
Storyline The story mode is a very slow burning candle it s really slow paced and people are either gonna love it or hate it I personally like to take my time while playing games so that was a plus for me The main plot takes its time introducing characters building up tension and stirring drama so that the player would actually feel a connection to each character that connection can be either be negative or positive
General gameplay While on the subject of being slow paced it doesn t end with the storyline most elements of this game are made in such a way to be realistic for better or worse for example everything that the main character does is fully animated skinning an animal picking up hats from the ground looting dead corpses opening individual drawers picking up items from said drawers etc now that makes for some good immersion and RP experience but some people might hate it as it might lose its charm quite early on
The open world The world in RDR2 might not be the biggest or the most populated out there but it looks absolutely amazing especially on higher settings You re gonna notice the wildlife is quite sophisticated in this game you re gonna witness crows picking dead bits off dead people eagles picking rabbits off the ground or seagulls diving for fish There s always something to do in the game either it being hunting animals chasing bounties robbing trains starting a bar fight playing poker or some relaxing fishing there s almost not a single moment where you re all out of things to do This brings me to my next subject Encounters
The random encounters There s a lotta side missions in this game but other than that there s the smaller less significant random encounters Almost everytime you re travelling from point A to point B you re gonna encounter one Either it being saving a random girl from a kidnapper saving some random guy from wolves getting ambushed by rival gangs coming across people robbing others the world always feels alive which is amazing
Voice acting and soundtack The game features a whole lot of talented voice actors for this game the one you re gonna hear the most would be Roger Clark the voice actor for the main character Arthur Morgan he s always gonna have something to say about the situations you find yourself in the game whether it being in a mission or just randomly roaming about You d see the main character singing to himself or blaming his temper after killing someone innocent or talking to his horse while cleaning it
The soundtrack is amazing as well you d hear some great calm serene tracks during scenes like riding out a snowy mountains or some epic western music when in a huge gun fight The music doesn t overstay its welcome and it leaves you to your normal gameplay when there s no need for it to be there
The graphics The game looks absolutely amazing you d ride around breathtaking vistas gorgeous snowy mountains smoke surrounded cities foggy swamplands or barren deserts and the game manages to look amazing throughout every landscape you come across
TLTR the game is quite slowpaced but it can be a great experience for those who appreciate such game designs
It can be fun when played with real friends but that s personally as far as I m personally going to go with praising the online part It may be just my opinion but the online part absolutely throws everything good about the singleplayer campaign out the window and indroduces some lackluster and barebone system to either get players grinding or get them to buy gold bars to avoid the grind
Most of the things you do in online aren t that fun I often found myself TRYING to enjoy it
It greatly suffers from lack of content as everything it currently has is quite barebone and often buggy
It can clearly use some love from R team for it to be more enjoyable But right now it s a meh experience
All in all the single player campaign is absolutely worth every penny for those who like the points I ve mentioned But I d do a bit of research before buying the game just for the ONLINE aspect of it
Red Dead Redemption 2 is not a game but an experience
You are experiencing the story of Arthur Morgan a member of a group that wants to live by their own rules and try to make their own future in 1899 s USA Their story serves as a prequel to the first RDR game
Story wise the game progresses similar to any typical GTA game slowly climbing the ranks of crime and doing jobs with increasingly dangerous gang members but the difference between RDR2 and most of the GTA games is that here the story is the focus of the game instead of the action
Gameplay wise the game progresses very slowly and you will need to make sure you have a lot of free time per sitting to play this game as one hour a day wont be enough to fully experience the game as intended Every animation takes its time at some points you would feel like its somewhat of an RPG grind but thats the charm of RDR2 as it forces you to embrace the nature of the game and take it all in instead of rushing between different jobs Personally it took me 100 hours to finish the story mode and i ve barely scratched the surface when it comes to completing all the side stuff and boy oh boy there are plenty of those
RDRO wants to give a very similar experience to GTA V Online but it fails to do so in a few ways
First of all expect to have no real help with getting around the game mode as you ll have little sense of whats going on and where to go Its going to be really helpful to play at least 10 20 hours in single player mode before jumping into online so you can understand how RDR mechanics even work
2nd expect the game world to be empty of actual players because the game mode is dying and also because Rockstar is hiding most players from the map due to past griefing problems can google about this
And lastly the last nail in the coffin is how they push pay 2 win mechanics and grinding into the game Basically instead of just doing jobs for money so you can upgrade your gear and buy new outfits the game tells you to first grind gold bars by a broken awards system so you can assign yourself to a role by which you will do normal jobs to earn more money and gold Online mode tries to be as unwelcoming as possible to new players who just want to play some jobs with friends as in most cases you will find a lacking online experience that puts you on an empty server as a new character If you search fastest ways to earn gold on youtube you will see what i mean about how the grind works Personally i gave up with Online at level 20 when i realised its going to be a really unwelcoming experience to just get started with the game
As for loading times they seem much shorter than in GTA V Online so thats one positive i can say here tho expect similar Rockstar server hiccups
Performance and optimization is where the game lacks a bit used to be much worse when it launched tho Rockstar didnt do a fine job porting this game into the PC platform and it can be sensed mostly when riding horses navigating on foot and doing certain actions with certain key buttons Nothing out of the ordinary but know these things exist
When it comes to performace the game is really demanding Personally i own an AMD RX 5700xt GPU with a Ryzen 5 2600x CPU and i get solid 75FPS on mid settings at 1440p cranking the settings to ultra brings down the fps to around 30 again at 1440p Gameplay can stutter when entering towns and cities There are 2 ways to solve this stuttering issue
1 Lower the overall settings of the game
2 Change the API from Vulkan to Directx12 this may cause other problems of its own tho
Make sure you have a beastly PC as this game is not a game that you d want to play on low detail Also check optimization videos on youtube and guides on steam community about which setting to set to which value for optimized FPS and detail
Both the special edition and the ultimate edition add some xp bonuses cosmetics practical gear and fast horses and some money in online mode You can google the full list
So which game version should you buy
In most cases i would advise to go for the cheapest version as everything else feels like useless cosmetics and pay to win mechanics with no real added DLC content however when this game goes on sale Rockstar deliberatedly gives higher sale value on the higher tier versions 20 for base game 33 on special and 40 on ultimate thus leaving the actual price margins to be only a few dollars so with that in mind it will make little sense to buy the base game so wait for a sale and then get the ultimate edition unless you have no interest what so ever about the things that are added
Great I am now addicted to whiskey cigs and random bursts of rootin and tootin in public
11 10
I ve got a plan Arthur
The game has been good overall plays well looks gorgeous But today I went to play it and it seems as if Steam is claiming purchase the game I tried contacting support but the support page keeps directing me to rockstar I didn t buy it through RockStar I have been on Steam for almost 12 years come on guys we want YOU too help us when we buy it on YOUR platform Fix this and I have nothing to complain about
There are enough reviews out there that tell you that this game is a
The usual points being that the game is a slow burn
That s true because it
But it is made to be that way so that you have time to slowly get to know the characters that are introduced to you Slowly you begin to form your own biases and conclusions for each character as Arthur interacts with them
You make decisions that will impact how everyone sees you and how everyone will treat you Though I would have wanted to explore that a bit more your decisions are gonna be influenced by the karma meter I would have liked to be able to stay right in the middle
like a grey moral area between good cowboy and bad cowboy but oh well
The graphics are amazing let s just get that out of the way It looks great the weather system is a little fast sometimes but not too jarring The biomes that simulate the arid areas the cold areas and the more temperate areas are superbly done I especially hate the swamp lands cause it gives me that gross humid feeling and it is frankly pretty great since its able to make me feel that way
Clothing options aplenty but with some limitations Truly the endgame is to be able to dress up in many different outfits and be able to put on different looks whenever the mood strikes you There s a decent amount of clothes you can layer but sometimes the physics kind of bug out This part specifically for the online version cause the tail coats have a bug that give your character some extra cake
There is a good selection of playable guns and I love the fact that you can customize them as well Who wouldn t wanna ride off in the sunset with a pair of golden revolvers Pearl handles too
If the first few hours of the game don t hook you in you might not enjoy the rest of the actual game If you re struggling to make it past the first bit I urge you to trudge along and at least give it a fair chance It gets a lot more fun trust me
Oh the free roaming is great You can ignore the storyline completely so that you can just ride around RP ing as a cowboy or whatever you wanna do Standard rockstar open world but no cars only horses
The best part that I like about RDR2 is the hunting
You can just chill out and instead of doing the usual thing where you shoot people
you can just go hunting instead stalk your prey strike and skin em Make em into clothes n stuff
This is a spoiler free summarized review of the story mode
This game has no story
Like playing Temple Runners for the story
It s there for the people who want it
Well written
Epic story prequel to RDR1 but friendly to new players
Imagine Kingdom Hearts but on crack
High end might crash every now and then if you dont meet the system requirements
Runs great while looking superb holding a solid 50 60 fps with Ultra textures and mostly medium high everything else on a 5 year old rig GTX 970 i5 4690k 16GB of old RAM Looks pretty much equivalent to console while holding good enough fps considering my hardware
HOWEVER I ve seen lots of people complaining about performance so be warned you may have to do some tweaking in the settings before you get performance you re happy with but I think it is well worth the 10 minutes tops of effort
This game is a pretty standard R Affair Overly linear mission structure simplistic combat excessive aim assist when using a controller if you ve played GTA V you know what to expect However the writing full of likeable and unlikable and interesting characters with understandable motivations and actions Story is a major plus for the game so far
The online experience of Red Dead Redemption 2 has many of the same qualities that GTA Online had which comes with some pros and cons The grind is real it takes a while to level up and things can feel a bit limited at first but joining posses with randoms is a great way to try out some of the later content before you ve unlocked it as well as earning yourself some cash and gold I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly I gained gold which is the premium currency of the the Online mode Playing with friends will be a guaranteed good time just like with GTA Online
All in all this game runs pretty damn well on my outdated system while still looking far better than I expected The gameplay is less than superb but the immersion and story is enough for me to foresee myself dumping hundreds of hours into the game The story has already sunk its claws of intrigue into me and I doubt it will be long before I ve completed it
1890 it s the end of the millennia and with it the end of an era the era of outlaws as industrialization reaches all the corners of the United States it s the arrival of modern civilization
Let s get the cat out of the bag as soon as possible Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of my favorite games of all time but no game is exempt of things that could be changed so let s see what s going on with this game shall we
Main story is made up of three acts that I will call from blindly following to breaking free in which all our characters will evolve in a very surprisingly deep way that we don t usually see in other Rockstar games The structure of the story is actually simple the gang arrives at a new place running away from an old trouble gang gets in trouble and needs to move to a new location while the gang has internal frictions that slowly breaks the group
Make no mistake this is not an endless cycle of running away it is clearly visible how the group is slowly getting worse both internally and externally not only their camps get worse overtime with declining living conditions and a very thin brotherhood that it s getting thinner day after day but also problems get bigger and bigger until everything collapses The story is superb and completely destroys it s characters by exposing the true nature of an outlaw life a decadent and obscure life of escapism violence and death
This story wouldn t be possible if it wasn t for the so well constructed characters such as Arthur Morgan the main character Arthur is a Dutch s blind follower but at the same time is a co leader for the band as he s one of the most trustful members of the group His personal background is what makes him the ideal main character for this game since young he has known poverty violence pain and crime another lost boy that gets into Dutch hands this is why his lifestyle is surrounded by the same violence he experienced and makes impossible for Arthur to establish a relationship or keep a family the gang is his family now and that s the dynamic of the game how his family and his vision of everything that surrounds him will change
The Evolution of Arthur is really well done all his perception changes are made by subtle situations that will escalate over time from day to day situations to really challenging ones Arthur has a heart inside him a sad story behind and a not so bright future in front of him but it s remarkable how we can empathize with him at certain points to the point when we might even care about him
Not only the story is really well done the representation of the South East of the United States of late 1800 s a nation of contrast still healing from a not so far war and a country that it s experiencing numerous changes not only in technological terms but also when it comes to bureaucracy and law the old world is dying as the new millennia approaches and you can clearly see that in the different regions of the map from the little rural communities the untouched natural landscapes overflowing with wildlife to the complete industrialization of the big cities The differences between the old and the new ways are also visible through the citizens how they interact with each other their talking everything is so amazingly well crafted to give differential elementos to each region and NPCs
This couldn t be possible if it wasn t for the enormous amount of technology and fidelity inside this game it s possibly one of the most impressive games out there and I m not only referring to visual elements which are stunning but also depth in terms of interaction animation and reactive moments Let s talk about this visually this game is a juggernaut the beauty of a more natural US the fidelity of the buildings the different regions it s absolutely incredible
In terms of animations and reactivity of the characters with the elements of their surroundings is top notch I know this element might be divisive due to the slow pace of each interaction however it feels really natural and for me while not necessary it really helps to build this feeling of immersion on this digital world in general every element of this game is built to make you feel immersed and create the illusion of realism it does an stunning job seriously
This game is very demanding so please keep in mind that I would say my experience in terms of performance was really great with a very consistent performance of 60fps aside of certain extra demanding areas such as Saint Denis but in general consistent performance and a great quality a mix of mid and ultra with tons of trial and error until getting the desired performance I seriously recommend to toy a bit with the options until you get the experience you want
Visually impressive animations are top notch what about the music and sound design Of course it keeps a very high level sound is in general really good nature feels natural and industry feels industrial redundant I know hehe but it fits really well on their respective zones but the important part here is the soundtrack is it any good
Yes the soundtrack is good very noticeable tracks here and there scripted moments with an specific mood that really changes the feeling of the scene completely and a good variety of styles the most noticeable the Spaghetti western music style with those distinct tones for example it s indeed a good soundtrack
So if everything is good why did I say at the very beginning of this review that there were some things that could be changed in order to make a better product Well this is a very personal opinion but game focuses too much on John Marston and I feel like at times this game is more about John than about Arthur at times plus the epilogue feels unnecessary after Chapter five I feel like they could have done it differently to make it feel important however for me it feels like something that shouldn t be there or should be a completely separated thing from the main campaign but even then it was good and the content was well written with very special moments
Also please take in mind that the pace of this game goes from slower to quicker the further you go in the story brace yourselves and be patient while the first two chapters are really slow from chapter three up to the end of the game is a roller coaster of key moments Is this a bad thing Absolutely no but I think it s important as a lot of people will feel like this game is really slow and will probably drop it before it gets really interesting
In conclusion after all I have said here it is clear that I will recommend you to play this game however I must ask you to please let you go and dive into this deep and marvelous world that is the US of late 1800 s explore the map meet the numerous people that live in there and enjoy the life of the outlaws and the story of Arthur Morgan this experience might be one of the best I had playing and I sure hope that yours is as amazing as mine
This was not a game it was an EXPERIENCE
Want depression Then look no further Continuing the tradition started with RDR1 this game will emotionally traumatize you so bad you will never know happiness again Staring blankly at a wall and crying yourself to sleep will be the new norm
It will also teach you to never trust anyone who has a plan or asks you to hAvE SoME FaitH SOn
11 10 i wanna be a cowboah now an emotionally traumatized cowboah
Red Dead Redemption 2 achieves its aim to create a immersive and realistic world in which to play out its Western drama The game is intentionally slow paced which some may find off putting but this pacing is designed to make you explore take in the natural world and discover the various secrets and encounters that are out in that wilderness
This is not a game full of high energy action every few minutes but a slow and often lonely experience which captures the pathos of the decline of the frontier and the old west Personally I have spent hours simply cantering around the world greeting strangers interacting with random events and observing the wildlife nothing more than me my horse named roach in reference to the Witcher 3 and the wild It is visually stunning and weather effects and lighting can give even familiar areas a different atmosphere
In the critical reviews there s a lot of negative remarks about spending most of the time riding or no fast travel I just don t understand this criticism Why would you not want to ride through remarkable scenery encountering random things on the way while heading to your mission The hours spent riding through the world were probably the most immersive most enjoyable experiences I ve had in an open world game for many years Without that riding I would never have been ambushed by the O Driscolls on my way back to valentine never met a crazy old man who tried to steal my horse never camped in the wilderness and been threatened by a couple of crazy rednecks never found out about the secret history of a certain abandoned saloon
If games are only about action for you then avoid this If they are about the experience then this game will provide you hundreds of hours of entertainment
Best Graphics settings for RDR2 for low to high end pc
The game is a masterpiece fantastic and goodlooking Yes we know it had a bad launch and is very badly optimized mostly But there is a fix Follow my guide here First of all there are lot of graphics settings you do not need to set ultra to make the game good looking There are also lots of settings that does not impact performance if you set it to ultra You just need the correct combination Come on its rockstar they gave graphics options that you dont know and you dont need First Those people whos game is not launching and stuck in Rockstar Launcher here is the fix Open a new windows user and login steam from there and start the game If the game runs there you may have a issue with your os Try updating windows if that does not work install a fresh windows
Perfect Settings for everyone who wants to make it looks great and also want to have FPS

Rockstar Launcher and Rockstar services issues where you cant play the game offline
Online is just ok not good not great just ok
Already Knew the story and played few missions on sibling s PS4 but playing the game and going through the character s mind set and story with different honor level will really make you love this game
I think this game deserves a rightful deep insight because its no easy task after being overloaded by it The importance of it nowadays the example it sets for gaming and why you should reserve this game a special place so you don t miss all the fun
I can see how one influences another but the story mode isn t harmed so Online can exist you re not going to be harassed by any micro transactions while on singleplayer The Online is just a choice by definition you even have the option to turn off friend s invites There will be no propaganda of other games in the menu either like Ubisoft and Capcom usually do There is no immersion breaking items demanding you to PRETEND they aren t there
I was afraid of buying this because I was skeptical that a game could be better than RDR1 with John Marston I also avoided it due the highly inflated price in my country bolsonaro vai tomar no c The current sellout discount this month was my best chance This game is a perfected RDR1 if such witchery is even possible
If you re not an immersive gamer you ll learn to be There are a lot of gameplay mechanics to suit every gamer but they re so intuitive and sophisticated it tends to incentivize you to adjust to a survival hybrid You can be the good bad guy the canon R expects from you be a chill Boomhauer or just be the bad bad guy Sneak bomb kill hunt whatever you wish or if chaos suits you even the smallest of things got a lot to show as you have probably heard already
Now while the Online game preserves some of it surely isn t the same direction You can fully customize a character but he she lacks voice for logical reasons thus no substance it has story progression but things are much less dense less interesting for me Not my thing to wait for unpredictable randoms but fun guarantee with known friends Again it is a different driving force in there that requires a mood I don t always have
When it comes to feelings however assuming you were convinced to accept the story s pace you ll have time to feel incredible moments and to see beautiful places especially with decent graphics Not everything will depend on it though only a few games can break the boundary between here and there merely by some flow The adverb stands for where and when the game is taking place but also how
Many tribes consider wolves to be related to humans because of the wolf s dedication to its pack Loneliness can trigger immersion sometimes it is the world or the time period sometimes it s everything combined RDR2 story mode has all that but it also adds bounding A gang can trigger unique immersion until the point of feeling at home then you know the writer was inspired voice and body actors were on fire and the development team resonated As important as your people are so must be your foe giving reasons and further tightening that bounding
This isn t my first time feeling it Comradery is also in many other games like Mass Effect Republic Commando FC Primal even Lost and Damned and Cyberpunk nomads living in my soul But it is definitely the first time I feel it in my blood
If you wish to get high with such sweet endorphins you can start by dealing with what you don t believe Like killing brawling or robbing imprudently you will do that a lot or fall to redemption Of course I despise gangsters but I can see why they can t fit in So it is easy to find spatial immersion but easy to get it busted too Someone may storm your room maybe your neighbor is a noisy ass messing with your focus or perhaps your cat is very sick today Until they re gone or if you go fix them and of course you must pay attention to the story If you think immersion is for crazies here s what
once said about the importance of suspension of disbelief
If you think Tolkien was crazy at least you d respect him more than you respect me
I like to criticize and I finally managed to nitpick irrelevant things no one gives a xith about but may be visible to vagabonds so here I come

Now a special words to developers shouldn t you start doing it like R does Quit with all the singleplayer manipulation for the love of god It is your job to avoid breaking it not mine to accept or pretend This game just proves it right

I d like to preface this review by saying few things This is gonna be a SPOILER FREE review and it will be based entirely on the story mode of the game The review is my personal take on the game as a whole So it is quite natural that some of the multitude of other players who have played been playing this game may differ with what I am gonna write Opinions are subjective and I am sure everyone understands that Last but not the least I am writing a review after a long time So bear with me Having said all that let s dive right into it
OPEN WORLD
Red Dead Redemption 2 s open world is arguably the best open world I have ever been a part of It is a dynamic world teeming with life in every nook and cranny From livestock towns to marshy swamps to hustling and bustling metropolis to snowclad mountains to barren desolate deserts the game presents you with amazing and varied environments and vistas to explore The seamless blending of all these diverse locations as you traverse through the sprawling open world is truly impressive There are no annoying loading screens which makes it all the more immersive
GRAPHICS
The visual fidelity of the game is absolutely gorgeous Not only the game presents you with breathtaking vistas but also the subtle effects as in the ears glowing red when sunlight falls on it is something I have never seen in a video game before It is mind boggling how Rockstar have meticulously put such details into the game The PC version truly shines in this regard
Here are some screenshots
STORY
I d just like to give a general overview here The story spans across a prologue six chapters and a two part epilogue It is well and truly one of the most memorable stories I have seen in a video game making the players go through a rollercoaster ride and experience a wide range of emotions The characters are all fleshed out the voice acting is impeccable and you really feel the bond growing with almost all of the gang members as you progress through the game Overall it feels like a really well directed movie with an engrossing plot complimented by excellent writing You just have to experience it for yourself
GAMEPLAY
The gameplay is fairly simple but has some certain nuances about it It is essentially a shooter as you gun down a large number of enemies in majority of the missions There s the dead eye system which basically slows down time to take out multiple enemies in one go Initially you start off with a very basic form of it but as you keep progressing you ll eventually unlock more advanced forms of it There is also a cover system which is appreciated but imo it felt kind of clunky albeit it works fairly well Stealth at times is a viable option with bows arrows and throwing knives However the inventory management is atrocious It feels clumsy and dated The horse AI is awful in this game as well It is very poorly implemented Talking about nuances since you ll be exploring the aforementioned diverse locations throughout your playthrough you ll have to dress up accordingly For instance if you re high up in the mountains you ll have to wear warm clothing in order to prevent your health core from draining out and vice versa Again the fact that you have to periodically clean the weapons in order to keep them functional is very cool as well The game also offers extensive gun customization too Having said all that the most important part of your entire playthrough will be the gang s camp As much as one would love to go out exploring and do missions I was so hooked to just stay in the camp talking to all the gang members listening to the conversations their thoughts and the stories they had to share There ll be times when the gang will be celebrating on some occasions and boy were those times so gratifying It all felt so organic spontaneous and natural Last but not the least there s an honour system in game which basically is a scale to measure the good deeds like helping people offering alms etc and bad deeds stealing killing innocents etc and depending on your honour in game you ll be able to unlock various outfits interesting encounters and even missions
SIDE MISSIONS ACTIVITIES AND EXPLORATION
There are a plethora of things to engage yourself with in this world The best part about Red Dead Redemption 2 is the unforced exploration The map is full of unmarked locations and Easter eggs that the players are free to explore at their own pace and it is rewarding especially the treasure hunts Secondly the side missions in game are so good They are funny well written and feature a wide range of diverse and memorable characters However some side missions revolve around collectables and I am pretty sure those wouldn t be everyone s cup of tea Apart from those few tedious collectables all the side missions are genuinely good and all worth doing and there are quite a few of them Lastly the random encounters in the game are equally brilliant and they are so varied and satisfying For instance I helped a guy by giving him medicine who was dying in the forest after being bitten by a snake and later I met the same guy calling me out in a town and talking to his friend about how I helped him As for reward I got to buy a gun from the gunsmith for free Very rewarding indeed There are so many different types of these encounters scattered throughout the world and each and every one of them is rewarding in its own way There are also theatre shows that you can watch and I was literally spellbound by the sheer quality of what I got to see It is mind boggling to see the amount of effort that has gone into making this game There are also mini games like Blackjack Poker Dominoes etc to partake in
HUNTING
Now Hunting in this game is entirely optional but it is actually a full fledged side activity in itself that requires patience but it is extremely rewarding and satisfying There are 178 different species of animals and birds in this game and a large number of them resides in their own natural habitat Not only is hunting required to amass food for yourself but also providing the same to the gang It is also required to craft satchels outfits and even some of the aesthetic camp upgrades The subtlety of hunting different species of animals with different weapons and ammo gives it a somewhat realistic touch There are a large number of legendary animals to hunt too and each provides a unique perk after successfully hunting one Same goes for fishing too
CONCLUSION
I d like to point out some things that has actually hindered my overall experience The performance and optimization of the game is not good Although there are many options to tinker with in the graphics settings overall it just is a sub par port in my opinion Secondly the Rockstar launcher is a bad piece of software Now I personally crashed only once to desktop while playing in my 200 plus hours of gameplay but the most annoying thing I have encountered is the bug where the game would crash right between the transition from loading screen to loading into the open world Rockstar s official solution to that problem didn t work for me However fortunately I did manage to work my way around it Moreover connection issue kept bugging me too It all stems from that travesty of a launcher This is completely unacceptable for a AAA game All the criticism and flak that the PC port has received are completely valid Despite all that this is a game that I thoroughly enjoyed every minute that I was able to play and it was a journey that will forever be etched in my memory I recommend it to everyone to try it out and see if it works for them

Online bad
In this review I m just referring to the Singleplayer mode
I don t think any game got to me the way Red Dead Redemption 2 did
It makes you laugh about Arthurs sarcasm and a few seconds later cry over a tragic family story
For some people it would seem slow paced but for me it was perfect and it might be going to be my favourite game of all time
Thank you Arthur Morgan for the amazing life lessons Thank you Rockstar for giving us such a well written character and too good a game Arthur you might not exist in real life but you ve been way too real than existing humans You are a legend and will always be a legend
Wanted to share my experience so far to balance out all the negative reviews I m sure those people are legitimately having issues but those issues do not affect everyone
Red Dead Redemption 2 was already practically my favorite game after playing it on PS4 and being blown away by the story gameplay and amazing environment in which it takes place Leading up to the release on Steam I was little worried after hearing about some of the issues with the PC launch but I m very happy that I have had zero issues with the game now that my wife bought it for me as an early Christmas gift No launcher issues no crashing and it runs beautifully
FRAME RATE TIP Turning down graphics settings related to water makes a huge difference I was only getting about 35 FPS near the river in the first area of the game I turned water physics down to the second highest notch and gained 20 frames per second Now about 5 hours in and the frame rate has remained at a smooth 55 60 FPS at minimum quite a bit more in some scenes with everything set to ultra aside from turning water physics down one notch
As long as you re not one of the unfortunate souls with launcher issues and crashing you re in for one of the most amazing video game experiences of this generation
This is not a game this is a living breathing world masquerading as entertainment
Arthur Morgan s story will stay with me till the day I die a flawed but noble if you choose to be so soul who lost his way and found family in a gang of other lost souls His relationship with Dutch is something special There are so many beautiful moments in this story

Best open world game
This is one of if not the best games to ever be released The story is immersive and compelling The gameplay is solid and rewarding and the world has a feeling of authenticity rarely seen in games All of this is supported by some of the best written characters in gaming history
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a must own
10 10
Soooo how to start When I found out that RDR2 is comming for PC s I was so freaking happy From the beggining of the game I could say that I m going to spend huge ammount of time in this game The Storyline is just a masterpiece The graphics are just F beautiful and the huge world ohhh man But because of the beautiful graphic this game need a very solid PC What about the soundtrack They just matched the in game music perfectly w a cowboy themed game I ve got to say this game is truly one of the best games we ll ever see
Awesome soundtrack
Cowboy themed game
Huge open world
Very interesting Plot
You won t be able to stop play this game
Characters are very memorable
Hunting There are so many species You can basically hunt anything
The shooting is really nice
You will never get same quest
You can still play even after beating the game
This game costs a lil bit too much
The requirements are so huge
Sometimes Rockstar Launcher crashes
Yes we need Rockstar Launcher to even play this game
Online isn t that good
Final rating 9 10
I ve played the game through when it came out first on consoles and I have over 1K hours in it 1K hours in the story mode 125 in online And it s my favourite game of all time The setting the characters the plot the dialouge the gameplay aspects customization continuation and everything is just perfect well other than the broken servers of RDO But the story just might be the greatest thing Rockstar has put on the table The fact that this game didn t win GOTY in 2018 shows how overlooked this game is Arthur Morgan must be the greatest protagonist Rockstar has ever created I never connected to a person so much that never existed It might just be the best protagonist of all time If you haven t played this already and you are looking for something to spend the quarantine with this is the game
The game is fantastic visually but the performance will leave a lot of people upset I have written a guide showing optimization options that still leave the game looking beautiful under Xbox One X settings nearly doubling my performance from 40fps to 70fps on a GTX 1070 at 1440p I hope this helps people out
Edit Guide link was removed so I needed to space out the link Thanks to haxo for the tip Full guide link also in the comments posted by me Sorry for the inconvenience

Gameplay tone sound design voice acting open alive world Interesting mysterious and unique stranger missions and encounters attention to detail weapons and customization hunting animals and so much more Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the best video game of its generation
it has a good story yet heartbreaking at the same time
Truly an AAA game
The best game in ever played
The story of the game is very beautiful
The game s graphics and physics are excellent
The characterizations are fantastic
The game sound is great
And finally its online part is also very fun and with many features and bugs xD
Let s face it this game is a miracle for gamers RDR 2 is hands down the best game that I ve ever played Of course this exceptional level of game design is not new for a legendary developer like Rockstar Games Even so I genuinely love RDR 2 it is the ultimate achievement in videogame development and Rockstar Games continue to represent the tip of the spear in modern game design with this release
You can hunt beavers In a river That actually build dams The attention to detail in RDR 2 is the best that I ve ever seen You know I m not surprised to hear that Dan Houser a major contributor quit the company after making this game it is such a drop the mic moment as far as I m concerned As RDR 2 represents the pinnacle of open world game design up to this point
I love this game RDR 2 is gorgeous intricate well designed and just plain awesome in so many ways It s pretty cool when mainstream resources come together with talented game designers who actually give a about quality Rockstar games have been the coolest game making company for a long time now like since the 1990 s even So I m not surprised that RDR 2 is more than just another AAA videogame but rather a miracle and an absolute delight to play I ll be playing this one on and off for the rest of the year and maybe even revisiting it for the rest of my life
RDR 2 is a landmark title and it is an example of the best that video games can offer at this current time We should consider ourselves lucky to have games of this quality available what more can I say It s truly the best game that I ve ever played
Ever watched a show or movie so good that finishing it leaves you feeling empty The realization that something this good will probably never come your way for a long time is both beautiful and terrifying at the same time Red Dead Redemption 2 is an excellent example in the medium of video games It s basically a 40 hour long western cinematic experience that puts almost every other AAA title to shame because of how unbelievably brilliant it is That being said this game isn t really meant for players who just want to have fun and don t care about how the story goes If you re one of those players then I d advise against buying this game because in my opinion although the side activities and various other missions are extremely well done you re eventually going to get bored However if you re like me and you love excellent stories that take their time to develop building up to a satisfying payoff then Red Dead Redemption 2 is beyond a doubt one of if not the greatest video games to ever exist
For a game released in 2018 RDR2 raises the bar quite high in terms of graphical excellence and fidelity Everything literally in the game is hyper detailed and realistic to such an extent that many other games seem unpolished after playing this one Even some AAA games three years after RDR2 seem lacking in detail some way or the other The weather patterns environments animals people buildings and objects are incredibly detailed and when combined together create a world that s just stunning Coupled with the once again highly detailed and impressive animations for each and everything starting from the way trees move all the way to the muscles around a horse s nose and ears it all seems so immersive it makes you forget you re playing a video game on your computer Additionally the lighting engine is just magnificent The full resolution ambient occlusion around people s faces and the way light sources react around the world is frighteningly realistic There s no texture popping or weird glitches whatsoever in the graphics department and it raises your immersion levels by several notches This game is truly the definition of next gen for its time of release
However it s worth knowing that RDR2 is a demanding game and the graphics optimization may or may not please you depending on the hardware you have and the settings you play in I played it on high settings PC specs at the end of this review and averaged around 30 frames per second which is good enough for a breathtaking cinematic experience like this
RDR2 s gameplay is vast and diverse the majority of which involves you riding horses and shooting people There s an almost overwhelming amount of stuff that you can do in this game apart from the above For instance you can hunt animals play poker get drunk buy new clothes get a haircut buy food and drink make potions and tonics craft arrows and bullets of various types rob coaches and trains help strangers and so much more The huge open world is something that explorers are going to enjoy quite a lot with no pointless or nonsensical side missions It s just at the verge of being too much however grinding for money and exploring much isn t necessary as the story missions provide you with just enough materials to progress In short you can choose whether to enjoy only the story or go full on role playing whenever you want and the game doesn t restrict you in any way The controls and animations feel weighty and realistic This game is obviously better suited for a gamepad but the PC controls are just about right and I have nothing to complain about Although there s no permanent fast travel system which can be tedious at times while riding your horse from one end of the map to another it s no big deal because the atmosphere and amazing graphics make up for it The variety and immersion in RDR2 s gameplay is straight up superb
RDR2 s story can be summed up as one of those awesome one time experiences that you have in life One that becomes a fond memory with the disappointing assumption that you ll never get to experience something like this for the first time ever again It s a long story consisting of six chapters and two epilogues but doesn t get boring it never did for me It takes its time to let you slowly know your people and get attached to them and it does that through the use of dialogue writing and cinematography so astronomically excellent for a video game that it hardly gets your eyes off screen Many people regard RDR2 s story as a slow burn but in my opinion it s that particular demographic which expects some sort of dramatic excellence in a story and it isn t their fault This game won t necessarily blow your mind with twists and turns nor will it necessarily leave you emotionally traumatized like the intro to The Last of Us but rather it will tell a tale about the outlaws who come to terms with their lives and deeds as modern civilization begins to flourish It s a story about redemption duh and by the end of it you ll feel like you ve completed a journey like never before RDR2 is one of the best examples in a video game where the emotions you feel in game are strangely similar to how you d actually feel in real life It s not too dramatic or overwhelming it s just perfect It glues you to your screen not because of a gripping edge of your seat story but with
Yes you read that right Hats off to the writers for crafting so many brilliant characters Arthur Morgan is without a doubt one of the greatest video game protagonists ever The way he s voice acted presented and developed throughout the story is nothing short of sheer excellence And this goes to literally every other character in the game as well I m not kidding Every character is pure excellence but for the sake of this review I m going to keep it short RDR2 s story might just the best video game story to have ever been crafted and executed this well in the medium It s a once in a lifetime experience and although it s not meant to be enjoyed by everyone it does what it has to do and easily destroys every competition there is
Overall RDR2 is definitely without hesitation the greatest game of 2018 and maybe even the last generation It has one the best executed stories in gaming history brilliant characters rich and diverse open world gameplay unbelievably good dialogue and insane realistic graphics I mean what more could a game need Go play it It s a masterpiece

Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the best games I have ever played The ragdolls are hilarious the combat is wonderful the game runs smoothly and the graphics are of course brilliant The voice acting the settings the weapons the horses the characters the fishing the hunting the debt collecting the dying due to advanced stages of tuberculosis It truly is an amazing experience
10 10 Dutch had a plan
This kind of thing is the reason I play video games
This game is incredible and certainly worthy of purchase no matter what price that it has listed I haven t even played the first game and this is still one of the most well written engaging and meaningful game stories that I have ever experienced While the plot does drag a bit around chapter 5 and some of the late game sideplots could be cut in my opinion I was still moved and in love with Arthur Morgan s story as well as how his story meshed well into that of John Marston The acting and the writing were all exemplary the kind of quality I would expect out of a big budget production like a movie
The gameplay can be hit or miss as the missions all have a very uniform structure and are the exact opposite of guided by player choice but that doesn t mean that there weren t plenty of fast paced exciting ones to he experienced Free roam was also fun though I would say that GTA V has much more entertaining free roam gameplay as it is much more off the walls and ridiculous That isn t to say that RDR2 s free roam is lacking though there s so much to do here that you could release the gameplay by itself without the story and this game would still sell like hotcakes
I am in love with this game It engaged me with an excellent story fun gameplay and an overall level of polish which lots of triple A releases don t have nowadays If you ve got the hardware buy this one immediately I am positive that you will not regret it
Best game i ve ever played
You re alright girl
Nothing To Say Just Amazing
Thanks to The Rockstar Games And All Actors For Making My Best Experiences In Video Games
Best game i have ever played and i have not even finished it
If anyone has trouble with the game crashing when trying to start a game as I was try switching from Vulkan to DirectX 12 in the graphics options that fixed it for me haven t had a single issue since
At first I tried unplugging the controller which I saw some people it worked for but alas not for me it didn t
only thing I changed is stated above hope this helps at least a few people
Haven t played much yet but is a great looking game and fun so far will update review after I am finished playing I just wanted to put this out in case it can help someone

i never thought one day this game would be available on Pc and i m impressed
i just love everything about this game
graphics looks so insane gun fights are really fantastic
the design of the weapons horses houses and well done everything is perfect
Story is really great with such great characters and amazing voice actors
even on the online part its really fun you can do some cool missions
you have some roles that you can level up and get some cool items
in general well done this game is worth buying for sure Don t miss this crazy experience enjoy
Masterpiece
Almost 3 weeks of playing this game 5 hours a day until I completed it The MAIN story that is
Better then cyberpunk
So glad I refunded Cyberpunk and got this instead
Red Dead Redemption II Story
Red Dead Redemption 2 is better than the first part I never thought the first part of Red Dead Redemption is beatable The transition from part 1 in part 2 was actually perfect Cool new characters came into that game the map is large amazing graphic way more missions You will definetly need many hours to finish that game to 100
Red Dead Redemption II Online
At the moment there are not that much options but already cool coop missions many clothing and weapon shops Im convinced the Multiplayer Mode will get more detailed soon
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece No other game has ever tried and succeeded to capture a sense of a time and place long gone while also blending social commentary so well Once upon a time people would overuse the word epic but it s a phrase truly befitting of Rockstar s brilliant RDR2
From a technical point this PC version of Red Dead Redemption II is simply amazing if you have a good computer that can handle its huge number of graphical options It is clearly one of the most complete games at this level On the other hand it is clear that an optimization could be better because even on a war machine with the latest drivers there are some issues that could have been avoided
It s hard to even start writing a review of a game knowing that no matter what words you use you won t be able to give the game its justice Pun intended
Rarely do I buy games
but this was the case and the name of the accident was Summer Sale I m scared of long games All three
bought but still untouched shame on me as a Pole I know Somehow I decided to give this one a go and I was hooked immediately
What I love about RDR2 and why for me it s been a gaming experience like no other
First the vastness of the world When you gallop on your horse hearing all the ambient sounds and watching various animals running around you really feel like you are actually there The care for detail is almost unnatural and all is designed in a way that lets you experience that world without loading screens You re just there Someone wrote that it s
and I think they were on point
All missions from main ones to random encounters with strangers mix together perfectly and play well into the overall story arc You can always
just to go hunting or fishing Everything s there from bears to the smallest fish in the pond Same variety can be observed in main missions from stealth action to robbing a bank or a train on the move
Gang s camp is very lively thanks to your everyday chores and duties there the characters including yours their stories voice acting those accents Also because of what goes around every time you come back after one or more days on the road when you were spending nights in the wilderness Several hours in and you start to feel like the camp is your home and your family
The dynamic weather and day night cycle work great no matter where you decide to spend the night The
is yet another nice touch It s based on your character s behaviour which influences the overall gameplay dialogues product prices number of available outfits or even the amount of loot you find on corpses The story is in sync with what kind of Arthur
decide to become I ve read that the ending you ll deserve will be just as synced although I don t know yet if that s true Redemption anyone
This game is also a great compendium of animals and plants For me a non native English speaker also a fantastic way to learn cowboy English
these are just a few examples of the many new words I learnt
There are several flaws but they can be lived with Clunky controls My horse switching from female to male and losing its name on a regular basis The abundance of what can be done in this game sometimes plays to its disadvantage in game tutorials presented briefly simply won t do You re better off watching some clips and reading tips and tricks on the web just to be sure you re getting as much from this product as you d really want
And of course this is a long game For some this can be a negative as well I strongly recommend not to
to the finale as you ll be missing a lot but it s your choice here and the availability of such choice to make is yet another good thing
It s a masterpiece Go buy right now I ain t working for Rockstar but surely love me some RDR2 10 10
My favourite game of all time The world is absolutely stunning it cannot be emphasised enough The views are incredible pretty waterfalls great landscapes I enjoy the variety of weathers Even the ambience is good My favourite map parts are Ambarino West Elizabeth New Hanover
Quests were fun easy to follow and I did every single one I enjoyed both the story and the online tremendously I did not connect with the characters much but I really liked some of the side quests characters The story was really fun to play regardless The online has fun events too the photography one where you run around take pictures of animals is my favourite and I win a lot
The multiple horse breeds in this game is definitely a huge plus from me horse girls will definitely love this game You can ride pet brush lead feed them Simply riding the horse throughout the map is fun for me I hardly ever use the fast travel option A great plus too is you can PET the dogs
The fighting is fun there are multiple guns I really enjoyed the Dead Eye which slows down time in the story mode It highlights herbs collectables animals which is really useful too I like how you can fool around in the map by lassoing your friends in the online or innocent passerby s in the story mode There s a lot of nice details in this game like picking up herbs selling them to a doctor going to a photography booth play poker or get drunk in The Saloon etc The online is a lot of fun to mess around with some friends
Hunting fishing in this game are really fun and the hunting wagon in the online is super helpful I loved finding all the legendary fishes animals as well as just regular hunting If you do not like hunting you can now also sedate them in the online and bring a sample to Harriet There are also online events where you can either protect legendary animals kill poachers or hunt animals
I m probably forgetting something but I simply can not recommend this game enough Absolutely amazing 12 10
The only bad thing about it however is in the online there are some people who will ruin the experience by blowing you up or something similar in the online I would also like to be able to pick a specific spot to place my camp in the online instead of it being randomised
Graphics
Story
Had alot to do in online mode
No Mk II Horse
Great atmosphere
Bad optimization
Crash disconnection issues
Comments
Well i believe the optimizations could be better And yeah not worth buying at full price cuz they made a sale 1 week later after release Overall this game is a must buy if ur looking for a great singleplayer game and even in online mode theres alot of things to do it is a good idea that they added ability roles to online mode
If we look at the entire gaming history we can say that this is the culmination of the progress of the gaming industry Personally so far when someone would ask me what my favorite games are without hesitating I would always just answer Mafia 2 Assassin s Creed I IV The Elder Scrolls series and Modern Warfare series but after playing Red Dead Redemption 2 I can definitely say that my answer from today on will be Red f cking Dead Redemption 2 and I haven t even finished Chapter 3 yet
Definitely the most realistic game I ve ever played A game in which the creators paid attention to even the smallest details and I think you will agree with me that small details are actually the most important segment of any project
To really mention any mistake or bug in this game can be considered as a sin because no matter what mistake or bug existed if we put it on the scales with all the positive features the weight of it will not even be noticed
I m really thrilled with every segment of the game and my favorite is hunting So you can spend hours hunting different animals learning new things about them and simply enjoying it
The scenery is simply enchanting and indescribable in words Indeed so far no game has thrilled me like this one
Although I am only in Chapter 3 I can say that the main story characters events and everything else are really really damn fascinating
I would write for hours but I know no one will read that much so I will stop here with the words if I had to choose just one game to play it for the rest of my life I would choose Red Dead Redemption 2
No technical issues starting day one but I have used XboX preffered settings to match optimization yeah I dont have 2080ti yet but 1070 does a good job staying above 60 fps on 1080p FOR BEGINNERS Long press start will bring up the map skipping the menu Also first person mode is very immerse please try Take care of your horse make sure to have horse revival or two
Story 9 5 10
The story telling in this game is near perfect
World 9 10
The open world in this game was again one of the best I ve had the pleasure of exploring
So much detail on such a big map Flowing rivers with dynamic weather It s hard not to feel like you re actually there The big disappointment here is that the enemy animal spawns are There are almost no predators and the ones that do exist always spawn in the exact same spot I have over 20 hours in the game and I ve only seen 1 brown bear outside of a scripted event Same can be said about enemy spawns The camps are always in the same spot and outside of scripted events you are safe to explore everywhere else
Gameplay Mechanics 6 10
You can t rob banks and the bounty system is broken There is no bullet drop and the shooting feels like a lateral move maybe even a step down from the first game Also there are no underwater or above ground components Swimming is pretty standard in most other open world games but I guess they felt that wasn t necessary either Most buildings are closed off Makes sense in Saint Denis but even in the rest of the world only like 10 of buildings are accessible It feels like a big tease interface is tidies and looting is not pleasant nor feels rewarding
Immediately went on sale a week after launch Slap in the face to initial adopters like me who got it on day one Absolutely no respect for PC gamers
Overall I ll give it a 8 5 10
Great but left a lot to be desired
But still the best way to kill time till Biomutant and Cyberpunk 2077 are out
P S There is a hidden setting in the system xml file my doc rockstar that everybody should adjust Find deepsurfacequality and change it to ultra This gets set to lower with these settings and causes the ground tracks footprints mud etc to render at very short draw distance Changing this has no noticeable impact on fps but fixes the terrible draw distance
Game of the year Probably even game of the decade As simple as that
I am genuinely sorry to those that are having actual issues with the game like the launcher being a real piece of work That is pure incompetence on Rockstar s part and deserves the criticism I personally had zero issues with the launcher and it s completely unobtrusive It loads up with the game basically as a splash screen and it closes as soon as I exit the game
I m entirely neutral on the launcher so that does not affect my view on the actual game itself I just wanted to share my personal experience with it
The game itself is fantastic and the visuals are excellent even with turning a few of the settings down I can t believe that people are STILL complaining about having issues running the game on full ultra settings It s been a trend recently in quite a few games for ultra settings to be a thing for future hardware or current top end hardware to run Not your bog standard 1070 or 1060 If you think those are still high end then you are sorely mistaken and need a reality check Suck it up buttercup and reduce some settings
Hardware Unboxed have 2 comprehensive videos that cover all the settings and their impact on frame rate and recommends what to use for basically zero visual loss but a massive FPS gain I m on a 3600X and a GTX 1070 and have a few things notched back to high and a few others back to medium basically followed exactly what Hardware Unboxed recommended and I have around 60fps average with lows in the mid 40s and highs in the 80s I do agree however that the system requirements are a bit misleading especially if people are expecting recommended to be a 1080p 60fps experience on higher not maxed settings
The actual gameplay itself is excellent the survival aspects are perfectly balanced to not feel like a chore like DayZ but also don t feel nearly pointless like eating in GTA San Andreas There s endless customisation in clothing weapons horses and probably a bunch of other stuff I haven t even discovered Barely scratched into Chapter 2 s main missions yet and I m already at 12 hours The game is significantly slower paced than RDR1 and any of the GTA series But it really does show off Rockstar s best world building and atmosphere yet It s an incredible contrast to the parody laden world of GTA But Rockstar have well and truly nailed it
TL DR
Temper your expectations on running it at all ultra settings Those settings are obviously there for future hardware I do think we ll likely get some more minor optimisations in future patches but I wouldn t expect miracles The gameplay is excellent with plenty of depth and side content to dig into Story is very intriguing and engaging Launcher woes are an issue for some personally not had any issues So be aware that you could well run into some issues with the launcher
All in all it s a great game and I don t really think it s gripes drag it down as much as other people are saying if Rockstar truly want to support the online as much as they have with GTA whether that s a good or a bad thing is up to you then these issues will absolutely have to be fixed So give it some time if you are skeptical
EDIT some additional words on the game itself since my original review lacked in that department taken from a comment response I left
My apologies for not digging into the gameplay too much I honestly still ain t that far into the game yet Keep getting distracted by hunting and side quests so some parts of the main gameplay loop are actually still locked for me lol That aside my review was more of a statement to try and show some people that the game is in fact NOT a technical disaster
Also I think a lot of people somewhat know what kind of experience they ll get out of a Rockstar game albeit this one is a much slower pace and a farm more gritty and realistic experience Personally I love it I was a fan of DayZ and the like back in the day Not so much more recently But RDR2 streamlines that experience in a much more intriguing and engaging package On top of that the storyline is fantastic so far with very likeable and distinct characters Hope that provides a little more insight
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game of the generation that outshines all of Rockstar s past works by melding them into one amazing story driven product The gameplay and especially the mission design can feel repetitive at times but the fun mechanics and sheer immersiveness of the story characters and world will ensure that this does not slow you down one bit
This is easily up there with being the best story Rockstar has done All the characters are portrayed excellently The characters you re supposed to love you absolutely love them The ones who you hate Boy it really gets to you
I have to tip my cowboy hat to Rockstar for nailing a prequel so well With the resolute ending that the first left with players no one was expecting a prequel I was skeptical going in We know what happens to John Dutch Bill Javier Why do a prequel This is why
Arthur Morgan is singlehandedly the best protagonist Rockstar has ever created The sheer amount of depth he has from how he interacts with others to how his story plays out makes him extremely likable Despite being a generally bad person Rockstar doesn t fail to make us empathize and care for this big fella As for the story itself sure it s been done before However the execution of the plot is top notch putting forth said characters first to ensure the plot delivers more of an impact The cast that accompany Arthur are superb I won t say much about them That s for you to discover
Much like The Witcher 3 was known for in 2015 and the Crysis and Battlefield series before that Red Dead Redemption 2 steals the spotlight with some of the best visuals seen this decade Everything from the stunningly high view distance to the small blades of tessalated grass and dirt It s superb Performance can be tough and if you can t run the game without keeping the texture quality on Ultra it s a pass for me This will be the future benchmark game for PC builds Can it run RDR2 on Ultra 60fps
Despite having some of the most in depth open world exploration and interaction I ve seen RDR 2 unfortunately falls into the classic Rockstar trope where everything leads to a gunfight The gunplay is fantastic don t get me wrong but after 15 20 years of this I d expect more varied mission design You will be shooting a lot of people a lot Almost every mission The gameplay is good but the mission design is not Now with that said once you re immersed and locked into the story this isn t an issue However if you halt for one second and begin to notice the repitition boy it can take you out of it
The open world exploration on the other hand is some of the best I ve ever seen in a game The wildlife is vibrant the towns folk are chatty to the point where you can actually walk up to them and say hi and unlike prior Rockstar games Red Dead Redemption 2 is the most open ended in terms of player choice Over the course of the game you ll see things such as buildings get built railroads get constructed and if you choose to donations being put to use It doubles whenever you get to a later chapter after a good chunk of time in story has passed and you interact with these characters who now act and treat you differently with their age
To many who say the gameplay is slow paced I would say at times you are correct It is these moments where the game shines through as opposed to the more streamlined shooting sections Immersing yourself in this world with all the sounds sights and wonders is an experience like none other This is the
you will get to actually being in the Wild West for a good while
What more can I say Rockstar has perfected the art of grabbing lesser known talent and driving them to the spotlight Roger Clark is fast approaching one of my favorite people in the industry and with the reprisal of Rob Wiethoff s and Ben Byron Davis roles of John and Dutch respectively the cast really has never been stronger All of these actors have such wonderful chemistry and seeing them deliver some of the most emotional performances yet in a Rockstar game truly shows the level of quality these folks perform at At times it really feels like you re watching a big budget amazing TV show All of the side characters are performed excellently and deliver believable performances for the variety of states and areas in America you can go
Big props to Peter Bloomquist for Micah Never have I felt more emotion towards a video game character than I have his Only a great actor with great writing can truly make it believable
Once again this is Rockstar at their best They have always been known for their games having catchy themes from the cheery yet gloomy Bully to the gritty and appropriate GTA San Andreas When Red Dead Redemption came out in 2010 they were no different Woody Jackson reprised his role as composer for Red Dead Redemption 2 and with the help of Dan Lanois they brought what is one of the best OSTs to the gaming industry Featuring the likes of Willie Nelson Josh Homme and D Angelo this score brings only the best the west has to offer while at times using not so traditional instruments The famous violin guitar combo make their return from the first game with additions to other songs such as brass woodwind banjo and many different types of percussions If you have any questions just divert here and rest easy
Don t read the comments to avoid spoilers
Sure the gunshots are good reverberation is fantastic and the foley is spot on Where the game really shines the most is its ambience Standing in the middle of a forest you will hear wind blowing through trees birds chirping coyotes yelping cicadas cicada ing Alongside the large cast of in game animals is an equally stunning amount of detailed sounds from the environment Everything you should hear you do Shooting a gun in the middle of the woods only to hear a deer scamper off messing up a shot on a hunt and having to hear the poor creature suffer This game is scarily close to reality and immersing yourself in the rich towns and cities only proves this It gets overbearing at times hearing so many sounds from everywhere All is as it should be and better
Rockstar had a bit of a controversy regarding the overworking of their staff prior to this game s launch Not only this but they have a history of suppressing the modding community s creations and overly monetizing their online resulting in a grindy repetitive mess RDR Online isn t there yet it s actually quite fun and unique So enjoy it while it is because I guarantee you one day soon it won t be
Despite the sheer quality this game delivers for some it won t even work When it does you ll find yourself constantly fiddling with settings finding that perfect balance of performance and beauty
1 Awful Pathetic
2 Has Big Issues Bad
3 Meh Average
4 Good Great
5 Fantastic
You know a game is a masterpiece if it makes you brew coffee using a campfire before drinking it or getting your weapons from a horse s satchel or just literally watching it s testicles shrink as it starts snowing
This game is simply the result of developers putting their time and effort into making their game as good as possible instead of marketing and hiring celebrities for years CP2077 winks
RDR2 won steam s GOTY and probably should ve won 2018 GOTY IMHO so there is not much to tell more about it Story graphics soundtracks and other factors are all top notch
And well Rockstar is one of the most controversial game developers rn because of many things they ve done recently GTA V next gen port after almost 8 years RDR online standalone game and more news around the canceled bully 2 project etc
But none of those things should affect how good this game is the most important thing about this game is how alive and active the world is and it s not just about the breathtaking graphics and attention to details Literally all your actions have a consequence and you ll see it sooner or later when you help someone and they find you in another city and buy you sth when you see the execution of an outlaw you captured before the amount of dialogues between NPCs the realistic reactions of people due to the weather time of day and such things just makes you feel like living in that world
This review wasn t about the RDR online tho I just don t wanna talk about it
Rockstar Games is like a restaurant Their service is very slow but their food is worth each and every penny and the wait
Bought this on Lunar sale I wasn t sure whether to buy this after seeing it has mixed reviews
The first time when I ran it it had an infinite loading screen Second time it loaded flawlessly in 30 seconds and the game s running at 30 45 FPS on my GTX 1050ti Never crashed which made me really happy
Here s my specifications
Processor AMD Ryzen 5 2600x

30 45 most of the times sometimes at around 7 and 9am in game I get around 25 FPS
I wholeheartedly recommend Red Dead Redemption 2 and here s why
It is a mature story driven open world game And it touches on some profound subjects like loyalty sacrifice loss and redemption And as such you have to respect the pacing and the time necessary for character and story development Things take time and good things take even longer But in the end it will all be worth it
If you expect this game to behave like a battle royale guns blazing non stop action clownfiesta you ll be sorely disappointed This game is the complete opposite of that It s about character growth meaningful choices and living with the consequences Not gonna lie a combination of all the things I m about to mention mixed with personal feelings made me tear up at a certain point in the game And that s the magic that inspired me to write this review
The prologue serves as a short introductory tutorial which in turn also shows off some of the game s innovative technology Gorgeous graphics volumetric lighting polished animations incredible weather effects and biomes all of that wrapped nicely in a very well crafted soundtrack suite
I was lucky enough to be able to run the game on a combination of Ultra and High settings And it is ridiculously beautiful And I m not talking only about the textures and shadows But also how the world itself looks and works All the big things like three dimensional looking clouds vast gaping canyons perilous mountains and treacherous swamps And all the small details like different tracks and imprints in the snow a million different animations for skinning animals collecting plants or interacting with your horse Clothes getting dirty dusty snowy muddy or bloody depending on where you are and what you re doing
I ve never seen a game have this many animations for literally everything in the game Every little action has it s own animation mesh and sound Even after 150 hours played I am still amazed by how detailed everything is
The game s story immediately gripped me and also gave me a lot to think about It s not every day that you play as an experienced outlaw cowboy that s also a part of a very homely gang of criminals The writing is on point the characters are all interesting and have a role to play And you will find yourself inevitably caring for these crooks and felons All the cutscenes are masterfully executed with a touch of Hollywood type of production Lots of beautiful symbolism and metaphors
I also found myself comparing Red Dead to The Sopranos a little bit As in there s some similarities when it comes to personality clashes dialogues escalations conflicts and that shocking realization that no one is safe And even major characters can be killed off at any moment especially when you least expect it I really liked that and I enjoyed that feeling of unpredictability
My favorite feature by far is the ability to make choices And choices always have repercussions Some sooner and some later but they always do And I love that I love that I can choose what kind of man my protagonist is gonna turn into Most missions will offer you a choice one way or the other And these choices will define your character s personality and alignment mission outcome and even the game s very ending
I honestly didn t expect the game s music to be this pleasant and memorable Rockstar games always end up having a good solid score But I never actually wanted to listen to it outside of the game Until Red Dead Because this game not only has this very charming fusion of western and ambient music But also a unique soundtrack that has been specifically written and composed for different moments in the game Very impressive and I admit that I must have listened to
on repeat at least 50 times
The world feels alive and lush with sounds This game makes watching your character light up and smoke a cigarette look entertaining And it s in no small part due to the amazing audio design Animals and forests cities and towns high octane firefights and relaxing nights in your camp They re all so immersive and well put together The little comfy parties that sometimes occur have in game characters actually sing and perform all kinds of folk songs That s lip sync face and body motion as well as actually singing and jesting That detail alone had me in awe of the game s excellent cast Some characters sing well some sing poorly but when put together it all sounds so real so lifelike You could swear that the developers just put all the voice actors in one room and told them to improvise and interact with each other
So many lines of dialogue so much variation so much talent Even the characters that you despise you kind almost like because of how real they seem
I played a good 40 hours of Red Dead Online and I have to say I love it You have a decent character creator tons of customization options later on and a morality system The interactions you have with the world and other players are extremely fun all around Hell just beating your friends to a pulp and running away from wild wolves together is an experience I recommend to everyone Oh and the Online s even got it s own brand new story mode A bunch of really fun and varied missions which can be all be fully played in co op But that s not even close to all there is to do
As you progress through Online you ll gain the ability to unlock new roles Such as Trader Bounty Hunter Collector or new Moonshiner These roles not only grant access to new missions and ways of making money But also unlock exclusive rewards perks and items that can only be gained from advancing these roles
There are also many different NPCs scattered around the game world You can talk to them and accept all manner of missions Some of them are good law abiding people And some are outcasts and outlaws looking for accomplices
In addition to all of that there are also different PvP game modes such as racing team battles deathmatches and many others You can also hunt and fish together or murder and rob everyone There s really no boring activity in this game And unlike GTA5O it has no stupid flying rocket bikes who spawn camp you the moment you leave a shop
My favorite thing about RDO is how there s so much new content that s not available in single player New animations models activities and items All the cool cutscenes where you can see yourself and your friends There s even choices to be made at the end of some story quests I was very pleasantly surprised by just how fun it is to play it
Amazing game with stunning graphics It s so realistic and the story is great Online is fun to do as well It kills time and has a lot of things to do but the only downside with online is that you come across some people who decide to hack and ruin the game by blowing you up or something Apart from that it s awesome and I highly recommend
10 000 TIMES BETTER THAN CYBERPUNK
No issues with launching the game but you re probably going to punch your horse on accident after playing GTA
The game is fantastic has great visuals immersive gameplay and vivid world full of content
However the performance is not great and it looks like the game is crashing on startup for a lot of people
If the game crashes for you then try the following steps it worked for me and i hope this helps people out
Launch Rockstar Game Launcher
Log in to your socialclub account
Press play on Steam app
Rockstar app should detect that and add RDR2 to your library
Press play in the Rockstar Launcher
Hope i could help
R has made another masterpiece in this game Such a fantastic western adventure I finished it PlayStation 4 in 2018 and this time i m on my 2nd playthrough Steam There is so much content in this work I only play single player so i have not tested the online component The port feels ok It demands a pretty good gaming rig to max out the graphics which is stunning So much details in the visuals It s hard to maintain 60 fps but it doesn t bother me much
Score 10 of 10
For me the game runs very well I have not experienced any problems in the game nor on Social Clubs I get around 65 80 fps with Vulkan and the settings below Around 60 65 fps in Saint Denis

Put simply Red Dead Redemption 2 might well be the greatest game I have ever played For a tl dr I recommend skipping to the end of this review
I very rarely purchase full priced games I tend to wait until games are on sale and even then I hesitate if the game is 20 or more Whilst at home for Christmas I saw that RDR2 had been released on PC I hadn t played the console version but had heard that the game was good so decided to take a risk and purchased the game full priced I don t regret it
To give some context I don t usually like buying AAA single player games with a heavy story driven narrative I like to play strategy games I like to play sandbox or loose multiplayer games like Mount Blade and I like to play open world games without being forced to complete the main quest I have many hours on Skyrim over the years for instance but only very recently completed the main quest for the first time I spent most of my time on that game just messing around in the open world I didn t enjoy The Witcher 3 quite a controversial opinion I know because even that game failed to make me feel anything other than boredom during the story
And so with this in mind you might think that I rate RDR2 highly due to it s accessible open world but that s not the case I rate this game so highly because it actually made me fall in love with it s story
Now don t get me wrong the other aspects of the game are wonderful The graphics are mind blowing The open world has been crafted to a near perfect level it feels alive and natural extremely large and yet diverse Everything from the macro to the micro level has been considered and these facts alone should make the game near perfect Those who have read my Assassin s Creed Odyssey review will note that I rate that game highly due to simply the quality of the open world Furthermore the gameplay mechanics the movement weight the feeling you get firing weapons or riding a horse it s all top notch this being an area where The Witcher failed
But the story oh my the story
I don t think I ve ever been so captivated
I ll estimate and say it took me about 100 hours to complete the main story give or take so it s not short However this isn t a problem at all Every single character is given perfect weight the pacing is superb the ending is simultaneously heart breaking and wonderful the voice acting is excellent I don t really know how much more I can describe without spoiling anything and this is NOT a game you want spoiled but trust me it is worth the time dedicated
The simple fact is Rockstar have raised the standard for video game story telling
Every game that comes before RDR2 now feels outdated and hollow Every game to come after will have to reach the bar This is a new generation of gaming and RDR2 is the landmark game
The graphics are excellent
The open world is expertly crafted
The mechanics are great
The narrative is absolutely unbelievable
But what are the negatives if any
Well I think the biggest negative and it s a shame because it really does put a stain on an otherwise perfect game would be the online gameplay
As I m sure many of you know one of the biggest appeals and biggest moneymaking successes of Grand Theft Auto 5 was GTA Online Rockstar have attempted to do something similar in RDR2 calling it Red Dead Online Unfortunately it is pretty clear that entire function of the game is purely made for microtransactions and to net Rockstar extra profits
The economy in Red Dead Online is purposely broken it takes an unrealistically long amount of time to grind for money obviously in an attempt to encourage microtransactions On top of this it s pretty boring I could elaborate but there are many many videos on YouTube that explain the problems with Red Dead Online in more detail
So unfortunately the multiplayer does ruin RDR2 a bit However given that Red Dead Online is separated from the single player aspect of the game it isn t too damaging
Ultimately whilst I may spend longer playing Mount Blade Warband or other such games with high replayability Red Dead Redemption 2 may well be the best made game I ve ever played and the story is a true benchmark for games to come
Final verdict 9 5 10 I highly recommend It isn t 10 10 because of the multiplayer scam by Rockstar don t buy if you want to play online and don t care about singleplayer
Red Dead Redemption 2 A game Developed and Published by Rockstar Games
From an early age sitting couch side watching classic westerns with my family i have been fascinated with the wild west With the outlaw lifestyle and everything entailed Travelling a vast nation on horseback with nothing to call your own but a revolver and your determination There have been few games that capture this GUN back on Playstation 2 did an amazing job Red Dead Redemption 1 was a great step forward and now Red Dead Redemption 2 nearly perfectly capturing the feeling And what a journey it is to experience
Red Dead Redemption 2 is the prequel to the first game you play as Arthur Morgan an outlaw just barely surviving being hunted by the authorities You make it free of their grasp for the moment and you begin to unravel the person that Arthur is or more precisely you get to control the type of person Arthur is The history of the gang is hidden behind secrecy as is the history of Arthur and how he came to be involved in the Van Der Linde gang Dutch Van Der Linde is the leader of the gang and players of Red Dead Redemption 1 will remember this name You begin to traipse your way across the country side living the life of a rugged outlaw and watching as the story unfolds before your eyes It is a well written tale but falters in the later chapters as the same cliche dialogue is seemingly reused over and over to drag the story forward The story as a whole though encompassing both main story and the stranger events is extremely captivating and should be experienced as a full entity instead of just as a portion
Red Dead Redemption does a lot of things really well one of these things is the gun play There has been considerable dedication and effort afforded to making sure this feels realistic and gritty which are both important in my opinion in this era of game The guns weren t sophisticated but were elegant in their own way and thus demanded a level of respect Which RDR2 captures seemingly perfect Keyboard and mouse does aiming justice as Controller makes click targeting seem tacky and cheaty Dead Eye significantly amplifies the overall gun experience though Helping you dominate large groups of enemies extremely quickly should the need arise
RDR2 offers a truly unique experience in not only its large open world but also in how you traverse and interact with it This is exceptionally true of its equipment with a large range of weapons and utility items to assist you in nearly any and all situations that might arise From hand guns and rifles to the lasso and lantern
Probably one of my favourite parts of the game Horse riding It felt so originally and real That it almost alone made me rate this game 10 10 I loved it It brought so much authenticity to the game and made me really care about the animal i m riding around Feeding it and brushing it constantly to make sure it stayed healthy You become committed to its health because it defined how good you managed to traverse the world
I m not sure if this is even the right word for it because there aren t really segregated biomes in the world its just a naturally transformation of regions from snow capped mountains and green open pastures to dank and misty swamps But the game has a vast quantity of locations to visit and does an amazing job capturing the essence of each of them so you almost get completely captivated in it
With a huge open world there is one thing you need almost above anything A map And a good map to compliment the whole experience Red Dead Redemption 2 does just this it offers a rustic looking map that helps denote almost everything you need and updating you whenever something new becomes available Extremely helpful but also completely immersive and assistant in making you feel like Arthur is using the map instead of you
Red Dead Redemption 2 has a huge amount of content to experience the chances of you experiencing EVERYTHING the game has to offer in 1 play through is almost 0 One thing you can complete to fruition is the collecting even though there are still a monstrous amount of collecting to do From hunting and fishing trophies to dinosaur bones and stone carvings This game will have you exploring every nook and cranny of this world to uncover its secrets
A returning gameplay mechanic from the original game that helps guide your decisions in some small way is the Honour system Doing good things gives you an honour boost Doing bad things cuts it down You gain certain things by being either and miss out on things the same way I found this mechanic to be extremely crucial to my decision making as i didn t want Arthur to be a villain more of a vigilante
The movement where do i begin With Keyboard and Mouse the game was unbearable in terms of movement and traversing the world It was sluggish and slow and felt like Arthur was always confused as to where he was With a controller the movement felt more controlled and manageable even though at times still extremely janky
Although the writing in Red Dead Redemption 2 is exceptional on a larger stage A lot of its internal dialogue feels confusing and contradictory to immersion Arthur wouldn t adapt his dialogue to people he would out of nowhere scream at passersby or vice versa passersby will scream at you seemingly for no reason Its not a huge loss but still was immersion breaking
I have nothing bad to say here at all This game is a visual masterpiece So beautifully designed that i can barely put to words what experiencing it was like Easily and without a doubt one of the best graphical experiences anyone can have in a game From watching the rain pour down and experiencing every droplet fall from the brim of your hat to seeing your footprints persist for kilometres as you ride through the snow or mud is such an exception touch of detail that it becomes almost breathtaking I couldn t run this game at its max settings without my computer turning into an inferno however Specs on my profile But i think this should be considered a compliment as i played it below its maximum and was still dumbfounded at times looking at the wilderness or overlooking the ocean
Another portion of this game experience that completely revolutionised it in totality The audio The music and sound effects in the game have been so masterfully crafted that you become completely entranced in it If you close your eyes in the middle of a scenic wood the sound of the birds and rustling trees as the wind brushes past them is beyond contemplation It s almost meditative in its development The way the world is just alive around you is what makes this game phenomenal
Not many games are given this by me This game is exceptional a few short paces from a masterpiece In fact if i had started and stayed on controller from the very beginning this probably would have rated Perfect This game is everything a game should be Beautifully designed world Exceptional audio and soundtrack that captivates the senses A story that keeps you on the edge of your seat and game play that astoundingly supports it all to a crescendo that is almost beyond words entirely You d be mad to pass on this game as its not just that Its far more than just a game its a journey and an experience And one you have to live at least once
My playtime includes only the main story and some side objectives as the save file states 81 1 completion at 91 3 hours That does not include Red Dead Online At all So from a value perspective it s a pretty good deal
You ve probably heard people gush over this game more often than not
This game commits one of the cardinal sins of game development in my eyes Placing the beginning of the game in an environment that is abnormally slow paced and not representative of the main game or gameplay loop I say abnormally slow paced as the game is slow paced to begin with but traversing the snow is even worse Almost languid The first 8 12 hours of the game is essentially a TellTale game that acts as a sort of tutorial that ultimately did not teach me much as to how the game actually operated The events were far too scripted to have any sense of how they d behave elsewhere I almost stopped playing multiple times during this period
This is a large reason why I feel first impressions need to not be counted into the overall score I don t know how they d do it really Maybe a check box the user can click and just go on the honor system on top of the systems already in place
The game is extremely character driven And I feel as though many of the choices you make are superficial and have no real impact
How you play and the small minor details are what I feel dictate the most change It s a much more subtle change in the end But the minute to minute details of Arthur s character are what change
Early on when money was much harder to come by and I would go out on hunting trips without any mission prompts Just hunting and taming horses for money Selling pelts to the butcher and selling horses to the stable The Butcher in Valentine remembered me 60 hours in when I went back exploring briefly He even started
me about going to see other butchers That NPC is my favorite NPC
The main campaign simply goes on for too long It s not a terribly unique story And I found it rather difficult to get through at times The whole premise is that you Arthur and the Van der linde gang are on the run from deeds done in Blackwater something you don t actually participate in in the game There s money you had to leave there and now you need to stay low and away from the law Insert Title Card But here s my problem This is Arthur s story And you re just along for the ride more or less
I haven t launched a game since Skyrim or Witcher 3 to simply roam around and see what happens I feel the game really shines when you re just hunting and running into strangers and going down seemingly random quest lines The main story is good don t get me wrong
The way the cities feel clustered making your horse more of a nuisance to ride and the amount of people that get in your way as you try to make your way through juxtaposed to the open air of the wild and how the sound changes of your horse digging into the mud from the pavement I started to feel similarly to Arthur not caring much for the new world
From RPG and survival elements seemingly spilling over into every other genre it s no real surprise to see them here Pet horse bonding eating and sleeping to recover your cores making your meters refill faster
that would fortify the meters from being depleted for a brief period Not to mention your horse being needed to carry more inventory
You re able to fast travel in the game Though not before significantly upgrading the camp You re able to fast travel from campsites made out in the wild as well provided you have a horse However the game actively discourages this as riding your horse will increase its bond and therefore its stamina and health As well as its value on the market You d also miss out on stranger missions and honor opportunities as I called them Random events that made the world feel more alive Though clearly very scripted for you to see Often leading to rewards down the line
Red Harlow theory in the comments Text limit
The Red Dead franchise is one of my all time favorite franchises so I may be biased but I will try my best not to be I have over 200 hours on this game on the PlayStation
Graphics
You forget what reality is
Beautiful
Decent
Don t look too long at it
Paint exe
The look of the game is completely breathtaking I honestly believe this is the best looking game with right settings of the current generation and will be better graphics wise of most games coming out next year
Gameplay
Very good
It s just gameplay
Starring at walls is better
Just don t
I REALLY love the gameplay It feels like a cowboy simulator but made by real devs and not in some dudes basement in the middle of Moscow You have to eat drink bath shave your beard if you like from time to time you have to build a bond with your horse and also take care of it But nothing is overdone to the point where it can feel tedious or annoying The shooting in this game feels so good You click to shoot and have to click again to pull the hammer back to prep the next shot Now if I was someone who never played this game and heard that I would think that would suck but you really have to try it to understand what I m talking about I don t know how to explain it other then that it feels so good and satisfying
PC Requirements
Check if you can run paint
Potato
Decent
Rich boiiiiii
Ask NASA if they have a spare computer
Not going to lie this is a heavy game to run I have a gtx 1070ti intel i7 7700k 16gb of ram and I can t run it with everything on high ultra When I first got the game I put everything to ultra just to see how it would run and got 20 frames I then found a steam guide which I believe is the current top rated guide for the game that I used as a baseline will link at bottom With the exact same settings as guide I was able to get 60 70 frames settings are like medium high Games already looked way better than it did from my ps4 plus having 60 70 frames just feels amazing ps4 locked at 30 and would still dip under sometimes I was able to change some settings after using guide as base made some things ultra and raised other things and now get 60 65 Have only played for 3 hours with no drastic dips just yet

Lovely
It ll replace your life
The main story itself is so much fun and interesting It keeps you at the edge of your seat the whole way through But you don t only play this game for the main story If you do you ll still get plenty of hours and it would be worth the 60 but you shouldn t The side mission are also so much fun Each side mission seems to be unique and more fun than the previous Not like other games where it seems like it s just copy and paste of the same thing over and over kill this protect that steal blank follow blah Each side mission feels like its own mini main story line extremely well written and fun
Game Time
Long enough for a cup of coffee
Short
Average
To infinity and beyond
The main story itself is incredible with so much to do on the side The world is full of side missions encounters challenges animals to hunt treasures to find people to lasso etc etc like I said earlier I have over 200 hours on PlayStation I completed the main story line and did a bunch not all side mission and there is still a lot left to do
Price
It s free
Worth the price
If u have some spare money left
Not recommended
You could also just burn your money
Side notes Some users are having problems with the Rockstar launcher I have not had a single problem I installed the game opened it the Rockstar launcher opened up for a second and closed and game launched I didn t even have to log in to my Rockstar account
Link to graphic setting guide i used
Make sure you can RUN THE GAME before buying as I said earlier this game is a heavy one
If you never played this game when it came out you definitely should buy this and give it a try I will be worth it if it s just not your thing refund before 2 hours XD but I honestly think that wont happen
Rate 10 10 will pay 60 again
EDIT I have not played online on pc or Playstation So I really don t know what the difference is between single and online But if you like single player games this is a good one to get and worth the price But if your looking for mainly online play i really don t know
If you ever wanted to be in The Wild Bunch or you wondered what it might be like to be Butch Cassidy or The Sundance Kid or inhabit one of Clint Eastwood s or John Wayne s iconic cowboy characters then this is the game for you It is just fantastic
I have had zero problems in terms of crashes or running the game I watched these videos and adjusted the graphics settings and get a solid 60 frames per second at all times
My specs
i7 7700K 4 20 GHz
64 GB RAM
GTX 1080
It s hard to find a flaw in this game Everything from the beginning makes you fully immersed in the game It s no surprise that Rockstar went into the development of this game 8 9 years prior to its release
Exploration
Unlike most open world games where NPCs are just walking as a fill in almost every NPC in this game is given a small story or a task This takes immersion to next level The random encounters mysteries and Easter Eggs are heart and soul of this game You d often find yourself exploring the world chatting with random people robbing homesteads interacting with mysterious entities and in the process forgetting for a short while the amazing Main Story this game offers
Gameplay
Top notch Plenty of weapons to chose from Very satisfying combat and realistic sounds adds to the feel of the combat
Graphics
One of the best you d ever see in a video game Detailing has been done on every major and minor level
Story
All the aspects above contribute in making the Story of the game an unforgettable one Arthur Morgan the protagonist is member of a Gang which is on the run and in search of money peace Arthur is accompanied by people who are some amazing characters of this game each having their own intentions aside from the intentions of the Gang as a whole
A worthy competitor of God of War 2018 GOTY for sure
Me Barely touches an npc with my horse
NPC ThE lAw iS gOnNa hEaR aBoUt tHiS
Great game immersive storytelling with lots of fun gameplay mechanics
How this didn t win GOTY for 2018 is beyond me
One of the most promising wild west open world games heavily promoted as such by Rockstar Games it did indeed deliver as a whole You ll find yourself in a slant when you first view the looming life through Arthur Morgan one rough gunslinger patching the outlaw squad you wake up along as your first player experience I absolutely loved the slow pace of your outset as the protagonist getting to know each and every lost soul in your gang possibly even get attached to some through their first lines of dialogue The characters are likeable and structured in a way for each to have their own charisma lower or higher they ll always convey something meaningful in the lessons stories and actions they re going to be sharing throughout journey Atmosphere has been nailed with near perfection in my opinion random activities in your camp from quarrels between egos to melancholic depressing or joyful mexican songs every town house and room you will stumble upon will have its own mood inducer I m not joking when I say that the wild life is the best I ve seen you can easily get lost within the forests huge open fields chasing from smallest mice to menacing bears And by the way I m talking enjoyment wise not realism even though it probably imitates life like enough Being able to interact
with every NPC you re coming across is one of the points which makes this title shine like a bright supernova in the dumpster of nowadays gaming market you can greet or absolutely antagonize the hell out of them so they ll snap or run away tail tucked between legs Horse behavior boosts the immersion a lot when traveling the lands take care of your companion and it will take care of you in need Be hesitant with your decisions of murdering innocent folk unruly impulsive deeds as it affects the karma system implemented and clearly shown each time you take a positive or negative action Without exception every act you conclude will rebound in the most unexpected moments karma always delivers
Graphics holy moly you can t avert your gaze from the screen once you re in there s too much eye candy for one to handle Heavy cowboy boots leaving prints in the deep snow horses trotting setting ablaze dirt particles as you rush through the lands The attention to detail will leave even the most pretentious player completely satisfied trees dropping the snow off its leaves mud sticking to your clothes and skin like glue after a drunken brawl and so on This is one of those games that feel like they re filled with a ton of gfx mods yet it s all vanilla landscapes are beautifully crafted to make you put down the controls sit and watch simultaneously with Arthur the astonishing views Gameplay is well polished to fit any kind of player who wants a challenge or simply plays for the story there s enough mechanics to have fun and mess around with entire outlaw gangs while you haven t been scratched once if skilled enough There s plenty of guns to have your desired arsenal ready at will golden plated shotgun for stylish brain splattering Customization feels very authentic to fit the wild west theme there s too many clothes to try at once it ll draw you back until you fully complete your wardrobe I personally spent hours shaping my outfits which I m very proud how they turned out I ll post my favorite creation at the end of the review Prepare yourself for emotional moments during roughest departures that happen within or outside the gang music quality and diversity is a huge positive as well as nature sounds you know like real nature would The story surpasses anything related to wild west I ve seen in a movie or played in a game every character has the same attention given equally developing all of them nothing will feel second hand material Don t be in a hurry to rush story missions there s enough side content to keep you busy for long sessions hunting for secret treasures with only clues being some poorly drawn maps helping fellers along the roadside doing most insane challenges which drain your mental health fortitude and maybe the craziest goal of all tracking every single objective in your compendium For me it s been an incredible journey clocked 200 hours of highs and lows all worthy of the time spent

I think Arthur Morgan is my favourite game protagonist of all time
Basically if you re someone who s into games with good stories this game is a must play
A standing ovation to rockstar games for this wonderful game plot and charismatic chars My fav one is Arthur Morgan I ll remember him for a very long time Whenever i see a horse somewhere in the movie or something i m getting an image of Arthur his horse Boy plus his quotes in my head YOUR ALRIGHT BOAAHHHH Its okay boaaah I love this character this booagh has the sense of humor And i also hope to hear I FOUND YA LENNY from heaven This game obviously made a great impression
This game gave me L u M b A g O because of carrying Dutch s heavy hopes and dreams around
Probably the most perfect game i have ever played since The Witcher 3
EDIT Online is broken Random disconnections constantly Don t get the game if you want to play Online Take this review as Negative if you want to play Online
I ll start off by saying that although I do consider this game worth playing and though it has had clear effort and care put into its development it is certainly no masterpiece and I fought regular frustration with it I was surprised to see so many gaming publications and fans alike score it a perfect 10 because in my opinion it is severely flawed It s a good open world game with stunning detail it tells one of the best most emotionally devastating and bittersweet stories in gaming history with great characters but outside of that I actually found it frustrating and shallow
The open world is incredible and full of remarkable depth From random events to NPC encounters a staggering amount of detail has been injected into this world by the developers who really did a fantastic job There s a stunning amount of handcrafted detail to stumble over that will more than satisfy most fans of open world games so if that s your thing go ahead and buy Red Dead Redemption 2 without regret
I ve seen plenty of praise for the graphics which I think this is mostly due to the fantastic lighting engine Volumetric lighting and how it reacts with fog and geometry looks incredible god rays are marvelous and the glow that permeates the setting from light sources serves to do a lot of heavy graphical lifting here It s really something to behold and combined with the fantastic soundtrack it serves to add a lot of atmospheric heft to the experience This feeds into the high quality and immersive nature of the open world one of this game s strengths
I enjoyed how the game gave me hidden side quests to find in the form of Stranger encounters littered through the world Many of these grow to add detail to the setting and its people and have lots of writing depth to them despite being little more than random encounters triggered by the player entering a certain area Despite the strong open world this experience is at its best during its thrilling affecting main story missions and when you re getting to know the very well written side characters in the Van Der Linde Gang via taking on camp side quests usually in the form of coach robbery hunting or fishing with them However many of the main story missions although they re often very compelling narratively are so on rails that deviating from the set mission path will often lead you to a fail state outright and push you back to a checkpoint and the checkpointing system is often poor For one stealthy mission in Chapter 4 I was forced repeatedly to view the same full minute long wagon ride into the camp over and over as the game failed me for trying to sneak into a roof window I later realized the game fails you if you go off the 1st floor and you re expected to sneak through the ground level This kind of railroading stifles player agency regularly and pulls you right out of the experience
Despite these flaws single player is a strong narrative with good characters twists and turns that mostly feel earned and are emotionally impactful well written dialogue and fantastic voice acting and performance capture Dan Houser and the writing team at Rockstar are at the peak of their abilities This is a well told story which makes important points about American exceptionalism frontier expansion human civilization and morality It s all helped along by the fantastic performance of the cast particularly the player character s actor Roger Clark A fair amount of the side content is also quite compelling but a lot of it does unfortunately fall into typical open world game territory which leaves you feeling like you re doing tedious busywork for NPCs whom you just met and don t care about Although I admittedly loved some side quests I began skipping side content later in the game after one too many collect 5 bounty posters type missions which was very disappointing
The slow laggy way that both the player character and horses control is awful unfortunately There were several extremely frustrating moments during combat in which my character would become stuck either on a piece of in game geometry or running in a loop which led to some frustrating deaths Additionally inventory management is an unintuitive chore and you re never quite sure which weapon Arthur considers his default as you re constantly drowning in dozens of them since the game doesn t allow to equip a main nor sell those you aren t using There s something very wrong about a game in which you re a wild west gunslinger yet half the time you attempting to draw your pistol quickly by holding right mouse button then clicking left mouse button the game fails to respond at all and you stand there like an idiot as you get shot to death These clunky bugaboos ensured I never felt fully in control of the player character and some of the game s fantastic immersive quality was lost as a result I regularly felt frustrated from moment to moment while playing this game
Despite the compelling main quests and companion quests this game also features some of the typical open world bloat that I ve come to despise in games of this sort I never want to hunt animals for crafting components for example Not out of any sort of animal rights motivation but because it s never been compelling for me to go out into the woods and spend hours trying to find the right damn animal to obtain materials from I ve also long despised hunting for treasure using only hand drawn maps another sin this game commits I had a particularly poor experience finally finding a treasure location only to open the hidden compartment and receive another map to decipher What a kick in the groin it was spending 15 minutes trying to scale Caliban s Seat to complete the first treasure map I purchased battling bad platform jumping and awkward walk run controls and falling a couple of times only to finally find it and realize it was ANOTHER TREASURE MAP This is the kind of boring time wasting side content I can t stand and I was disappointed to see it in yet another open world game which is an otherwise fantastic experience
Additionally the camp upgrade options are little more than window dressing Beyond gaining fast travel capabilities and gaining new satchels there s almost nothing of value to be gained by upgrading your camp which is a huge missed opportunity Because the characters are so compelling the acting is so great and the dialogue is so carefully crafted I found myself wishing for an opportunity to impact the lives of the gang around me by putting some of my hard earned wealth into the camp It s prohibitively expensive to do so and you gain little in game reward for it other than certain cosmetic flourishes If I could do it again I d have instead poured that money into my own clothing and horses It s simply not worth it and before long I began ignoring the feature entirely
There are also several sorts of minigames available such as poker or five finger fillet but most of these although they received obvious care in development in the form of unique animations and lines for the NPCs against whom you play ended up feeling obviously rigged to me The worst of this is during the poker game in Saint Denis which one player always just stomps and led me to think he was cheating in game But no further explanation is available so it instead feels just like he was programmed to take all of your money by winning lucky hands constantly I gave up on most of the minigames after experiencing this
This game lives or dies on its being a great story and a deep atmospheric world If you love immersive engulfing video game worlds or want an amazing story you re going to love it If you want great shooting or compelling gameplay in general you re likely to end up frustrated
Feel free to follow
if you like this review
Even though the game has been out for awhile I held off on buying it as I was not interested at initial release
I finally decided to take a real long look at the game game play and reviews out there Those pushed me over the edge and I now have RDR2 in my Library
Let me start by saying the game still costs a premium price for as long as it has been out That might scare some off who have tight budgets However for me it is one of those games that is still worth the cost
You are not going to finish this game quickly and feel like it cost 20 oo a day to finish a game in 3 days something I have experienced too often This thing takes some time and it is time well spent
The story is rich and engaging I find the main character Arthur Morgan to be fascinating and entertaining as I play along He draws you in to the game a game rich in story
Now the graphics well they are beautiful With my RTX 3080 from Asus I am running this game fulling Optimized through G force Experience and still get over 100 fps at 1440p
Replay value on this game will be great too I can see me playing it several times over changing outcomes along the way by my actions just to see what happens Now I don t feel bad about the price at all
Looking for a game rich in story long playing with great replay value excellent graphics entertaining as all get out Here it is you re welcome
RDR2 has an incredibly good quality on pc and its far from consoles but i prefer to lay down and play on a console and a 50 4K tv cuz when i play time passes 3x faster than normal

One of the best games ever made
If you love movies about wild west and your idol is Clint Eastwood like in my case you simply MUST try this The whole game does not feel mechanic but organic and you can completely lose yourself in just riding a horse and admiring the environment around you It will also make you feel emotions Just like when I found dying wolf that I ve injured a while ago after he attacked me and had to put him down Felt incredibly sad about it About digital wolf made out of polygons
This game is a work of art Enough said
Firstly yes the game requires a demanding PC But the amount of graphical details justify the requirements The optimization isn t poor just that the current generation hardwares can t bring out its full potential
The highlight of RDR2 is its realistic aspect The immense level of detail coupled with a near perfect physics system makes this game a truly immersive experience For added immersion the entire game can be beaten with HUD disabled The sun street signs and land marks can be utilized to reach destinations
Overwhelming use of realistic elements in a game turns it into a tedious experience In RDR2 there are some mechanics like gun wear feeding and cleaning your horse maintaining your health stamina and deadeye core with food and drinks etc Unless sprint and deadeye is overused or too much damage is taken these mechanics don t get in the way of the gameplay
Once after serving time I was released from jail and the sheriff told me to scram In other games it would only be a mere threat But in RDR2 I received another bounty and was apprehended AGAIN for not listening to him This much attention to detail is rare in the medium of video games
One of the few annoying aspects of this game is the horse Many a times early in the game I strayed too far from the horse just to realize that the horse was no Roach that will magically appear in front of me from the other side of the map So making the horse follow you everywhere is a must And the horse can actually die if it falls from even a moderate height Losing your horse in the middle of nowhere leaves you to a painful trek to the nearest town Still this is but merely a punishment for making a stupid mistake
However there is still a limit to how realistic a open world game can be In RDR2 there are medicines that heal you back to full health in mere seconds and save dying persons or horses An ability that slows down time and so on that makes me realize Ahh this is a game afterall But this much is necessary to not make the game too boring
The combat in RDR2 is pretty good but not fantastic Headshot is lethal for both enemies and the player unless the health core is full Luckily the enemy AI can t land headshots constantly The more dangerous wild animals like bears or crocodiles can kill you with a single attack which has a realistic feel to it All in all the combat is on the harder end of the scale especially on horseback Moreso the game doesn t have any difficulty sliders So to make the game more accessible and a less daunting experience there is the iconic deadeye ability Everything besides you will go into slow motion while you tag and kill enemies like a badass Though deadeye breaks realism its a cool core gameplay element Without it RDR2 would not have been the same
The vast world of RDR2 is mainly traversed on horseback The horse movements are quite Witcher 3 like However in RDR2 the horse feels more alive As your bond with the horse increases you unlock some cool tricks it can perform If riding the horse becomes too repetitive traveling to a certain destination can be automated But the autopilot on twisty roads isn t very reliable Also any major location can be fast traveled to
When not riding on the horse I climbed various mountains in my search for collectibles It felt as if the mountains could only be climbed in one set way If you could climb a steeper one you might not be able to climb a less steep one because it was a shortcut to the summit This is when the game punishes you for just trying to save some time Swimming is not used much and you cannot dive underwater or swim long distance
The side quests and random encounters were quite varied However besides some humor missions the main missions were all very similar
1 Go to X location
2 Kill all enemy in said location in a big shootout and rob them
3 Get back to hideout while having another shootout on horseback
There are some quests that start with stealth but ends up in a shootout anyway Moreover the movie esque main missions have a great contrast to the RPG like free roam activities and side quests to the point where they almost feel like two entirely different games
There are also some minor glitches in this game Objects sometimes clip through each other objects or characters sometimes fail to spawn requiring a reload of the save file Lastly sometimes the horse movement becomes clunky Getting off and back on it fixes this issue Overall there is no game breaking bug in this game just few minor setbacks which can be resolved
RDR2 on consoles looked great But on PC with ultra settings it might just be the best looking video game of all time Even the smallest of things unnoticed by many are created with a high level of detail The animations of player and NPC movements explosions fires and other minor movements in the enviroment are all very smooth Bonus props for the lighting work
The world of RDR2 is quite vast and filled with many activities You can watch shows play games at a saloon catch fish track down unique animals and birds in swamps tundras deserts grasslands and many more areas Saint Denis is gorgeous at night The game encourages exploration part of RDR1 s map opens up after the campaign solely for exploration This area feels like the last remnants of the wild west The setting truly makes you feel like you are in America at the turn of the 19th century
A merry band of misfits are unable to accept the rapid civilization of the country at the end of the wild west era Their objective is to gather enough money and move to a yet uncivilized area to live in The gang leader makes many plans to gather said money His plans end up causing a huge disturbance in that region and they are forced to move on to the next In reality the story is about accepting change and Arthur s character development from a puppet to someone who thinks about consequences of actions and tries to not make the wrong move After a certain point the focus shifts from just making some money to opposing America itself This takes the story to a generic direction but Arthur s later character developments greatly overshadow this
The characters named or not everyone has their own life to live They have interactions fitting for them The gang members have random chit chat amongst each other they drink and sing all night after overcoming hardships In most games the NPCs actions are centered around the protagonist But here not only the protagonist s but each member s actions have consequences on the gang as a whole They all are like a big family
The protagonist Arthur Morgan and the gang leader Dutch are the main characters of this story Dutch s character regresses from an idealistic person who makes choices with no better alternatives to an indecisive assh le who makes the wrong choices INTENTIONALLY His character just changes somewhere in the middle without really showing reason for the change Arthur on the other hand is the star of the game He was by no means a good guy But he tries to change tries to oppose Dutch s dangerous plans Arthur grows a heart and learns to do the right things
RDR2 is a huge game packed with content that will last one with over a hundred hour of gameplay The game is not finished after completing the campaign There are numerous side quests and a lot of collectibles and challenges that emphasize exploration The online mode is an added bonus This is what a AAA game should offer at 60 dollars With RDR2 Rockstar went out of their comfort zone to create a truly immersive realistic yet an enjoyable and emotional experience They have raised the bar for open world games and made something that can represent the progression of video games in this decade
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a western themed open world singleplayer multiplayer action game This game is one of the best singleplayer games I ve ever played however I didn t like the multiplayer version that much Here is my pro con list about the game
Exceptional story
Outstanding visuals
Great soundtrack
The best character development I ve ever seen in a game film TV show
Riding a horse is satisfying
Great physics
Interactions with the NPCs are highly effective in the game
Towns and cities are greatly decorated
Choices really matter both affects the game and the player
Board games are fun
Plot twists 3
You can talk with your horse
Atmosphere is perfect
Weapons and customization
Optimization is great
Game is well executed
Play time is long enough
You re alright my boah
There is no vocalization in multiplayer
Game is a bit slowly paced at the beginning so it might lose players who aren t patient enough
You cannot go back to the older save file after you die it randomizes the place and you cannot get your old horse if your horse is dead This can be counted as a good realistic feature but I lost legendary bear fur so I didn t like it
Overall This game is a greatly executed game with a perfect story physics sound visuals atmosphere gameplay and choices I would give 9 8 10 for single player and 5 4 10 for multiplayer
I I havent gotten into anything in a long time since my depression but i just cant stop playing this games
I dont have any performance problems and i got a decent pc
ProcessorAMD Ryzen 5 1600 Six Core Processor
Video CardNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti
RAM16 GB
Operating SystemWindows 10
my pc wifi stick went to but was still able to play offline singleplayer
i think you just need to boot into single player once to get past the drm then you are fine
Beat the game
micah
I must start saying that I got really confused due to the mixed reviews
Many people are speaking about glitches bugs and awful performance issues
Well I m playing on a Dell G3 laptop GTX 1660ti 6GB 16 RAM and i7 9750H
Playing on High setting and I must say the visual and graphics are just stunning
Gameplay is also a lot of fun and I m just after 7 hours of almost none stop playing
My laptop is not even super hot and not a single crash all that way
It was also very easy to start the game although many here are griping on the Rockstar launcher
If you love open world game this game is for you It s truly a masterpiece
Enjoy
Bought the game on Xbox One day one and decided to buy it again on Steam recently
Completed the game on PC as I did not complete it on Xbox
This was due to burn out just because of the sheer amount of time you will spend on this game take that as what you will as some will take that as a good thing and others a bad thing
So what are the positives and the negatives
The Positives Single Player
1 You will never find an RPG open world game that pulls you in so much that by the end of the game you will feel as if you actually know the characters that you meet within this game What I mean by this is if you have friends real life you will develop the same feelings to the people in this game and that is because of the amount of time you spend interacting with these characters That is because of the slow pacing that is this game you can not just rush through the missions and expect to complete it in a day you just physically can t Do not let the 22 hours of my game time fool you I still have not completed everything as I started with a save game that I got online that starts you at Chapter 3 and that was only because that is where I got up to on my Xbox game version
There are 6 Chapters in total in this game with 2 Epilogue Chapters as well
2 The amount of world building exploration interaction that you will be doing in this game would be described as a second life experience in the understanding that you will be taken away by not only the scenery but by how the NPC s in this game especially by the NPC s in camp I know this word has been butchered to death but that is only because it keeps being erroneously used for games that use gimmicks that give the impression of a real living world cough cough Skyrim But this game by it s very definition is an art form because when you step away especially once you have completed the main quest lines and you take a step back and have a deep think on everything that you have been on and been through it would have been one hell of a journey and you will be thinking about all that you have seen and done for many days to come
3 This is not a small or quick game to get through From what I would state if you was to do nothing but the main story quests 100 hours If you want to try and complete everything in this game I do not want to just state a small number but a mate of mine is still going at 800 hours so a 50 or 50 investment is a bargain for what you will be getting out of this game
4 With the coming mod support with this game just like any game Rockstar put s out this game will have longevity that will see no end so take note that if you do buy this game I can safely say you will not find yourself with becoming bored as you will be able to satiate your weirdest and wildest desires for many months and years to come
5 The game looks amazing and is the closest you will come to seeing a Bob Ross art piece in game form visualised in its entirety from your computer screen
6 You can customize almost all aspects of your character weapons and horses with some real depth to how your character looks as well Growing facial and head hair over a period of time will also give you a sense that this game is a living breathing representation that you are quite literally playing real life people After a while you will forget that you are playing a game
7 There are many positives to this game and I could go on for ages but I think these are the main points that should catch your eye Now on to the Negatives
The Negatives
From what I would expect people to complain about
I like the game no matter what I am just putting down what I think people will moan about
1 Not a negative for me but some people may or will see it as one but if I am going to be honest this one is on you If you have a computer that does not have a GTX 1060 or higher with 16GB of 3600 DDR4 RAM and a decent CUP an 8th Gen Intel I7 8600 basically a fairly modern high end PC do not buy this game and wonder why it won t run well or chugs then cry and moan about it it s your fault
I have a GTX 1080TI 11GB Graphics Card An 8th Gen Intel i7 8600 36GB DDR4 3600 and everything at Ultra and it can still struggle with FPS when near lost s of Water You will not be able to play this game like you could with GTA V If your computer can barely run GTA V you will not be able to run this game or play it in a decent visual form Make sure you have the minimum specs as exactly stated if you do not have them as they are written do NOT buy this game period Most of the people that are moaning and complaining is because they do not read before they buy
2 For people that have a low attention span or do not have or want to put the time and effort into a game that requires you to focus pay attention and to listen to the characters and to the world around them without you getting distracted by family and friends this game is not for you
You need to spend a good amount of alone time playing this game This is not Call of Duty where you can play it put the controller down to do the dishes come back then put it down again 20 minutes later You need to invest your time into this game to get the most out of it If you buy this game and you complete the main story missions and feel nothing that s your personal problem and the problem is with you not the game It just means that you are incapable of listening and investing a real understanding of what it is that you are doing in this game
TL DR If you can t stay quiet and sit still and listen for a good amount of time do not buy this game it s not for you
3 Very similar to the top reason but shorter The game is very slow to start with and I mean very slow There will not be fast paced action scenes and combat all of the time and things will not be interesting Michael Bay style this is not a game for you
It s not a Farmville simulator kind of investment as you can do a hell of a lot of things but you do need to invest yourself to get the most out of this game
4 The game is going through updates and patches on the regular so if you use mods expect to be waiting on Scripthook updates so I would suggest you creating a backup copy of your current game version just in case you want to downgrade Make sure you have 250GB in total of free space for both your normal version and you backup
Now for the Multiplayer side
The Positives
1 Some good Multiplayer exclusive stuff that will be ported to Single Player by the use of mods
The Negatives
1 Don t bother it s GTA Online in a nutshell with all of the Microtransaction goodness that flows into this game Certain things are locked behind Gold Bars which let s face it you will have to spend real money on because completing online missions gives you so little it s not worth it The same goes for cash you will be making a buck at best at the end of Multiplayer missions
Stick with Single player and play with mods
A modern masterpiece from Rockstar I highly recommend it to anyone that would like to get lost in a vast immersive open world They ve outclassed themselves once again
It s GTA with less traffic and your vehicles only have 1 horsepower
Let me see
I am pretty sure everyone knows Rockstar studio GTA and all that macho stuff around it We know what they are capable of when creating a game So when Red Dead Redemption 2 came out for consoles I was stunned I honestly never thought I d want game more than that I am a PC gamer honestly I suck at playing on consoles but I wanted this game so much I even thought of getting one So I bet you can say how excited I was when RDR2 was announced for PC And all the waiting was worthy I am aware that so much has been said about RDR2 that I can t possibly add anything new but I just wanted to share my experience with this beautiful game
The story is a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead Redemption When you start as
outlaw underdog you start a story you wish you d never finish In front of you there is capitalism the end of the wild west as we know indigenous Americans are pushed away just so another rich man can have his way And there s Arthur and his family Van der Linde gang Or just Dutch s Boys going by the mantra
The very firsts steps in the game make you feel like this Arthur is just another lost man Man who can not be changed Who is rough harsh brute relentless yet you can t just give up on him and you see him go through massive change
I think if you rush really fast through the game you can finish the story in about 60 hours but considering how huge and alive this whole world feels it s a terrible way to play this game It deserves so much more Go into that far west corner of the map and enjoy what s awaiting It can be an easter egg there are sooo many of them abandoned house or simply nothing but breathtaking nature Sometimes I found myself in the middle of nowhere on my horse galloping towards the sunset And you know what
The story itself isn t anything oscar worthy But I dare to say that
For the people who love completing games all the way to 100 this is the game for you All those animals you have to study challenges plants medicine based on crafting collectables Tracking a scent to find your prey Cooking your meal and giving it a bit of a touch of herbs and improving its quality
Many times you find yourself jumping into unexpected adventures by random strangers Some have multiple chapters some ends really quickly If anything it only breathes more life into the world of Red Dead Redemption 2 As you go by trying to get enough money for your gang
you really find yourself loving so many characters and you never know who you stumble upon
On my way to sell my pelts I was almost robbed while defending myself the train robbery was in progress nearby and when I finally thought I could breath and get drunk to finish my compendium of course ehm the fight over a poker game started On my way to the east part of the map I was drugged and robbed and bit further people kept warning me about creepy Night Folks killing innocents and begging for help and boy did I find them RIP my first horse Pototo
Crafting system is super easy and mid game special recipes keep the fighting fun The tiny details make it more fascinating After you kill an enemy or even animal skin it you can see their body decomposing over time The horses will sweat after you gallop for too long Certain parts of the map are deforested over time and you can see the progress And once it s done workers move to different locations You see houses being built in front of your eyes Now I can t just stop thinking about the unfinished buildings in GTA V lol And nothing makes it more real than your horse taking a massive and I mean massive dump while you re talking to a stranger and getting new mission
I am on my third play through Part on epic part here on steam And I keep discovering new things I missed before I laugh with Arthur and I cry
Now that was the story tho Same as GTA V we were given an online world full of fun and endless possibilities
well yes but no
You manage to create such a unique masterpiece like RDR 2 and then you dump Red Dead online to be a side milking cow for your favourite kid GTA V What a shame The bugs the endless loading screens CHEATERS lack of content for veteran players The Outlaw Pass 3 is nowhere to be seen and absolutely no communication with players as well While GTA V has many new cars events here take a million bucks just for logging in And the RDRO community Ah here s a 20 sale for stuff most of you already own Peace out
Horses I love horses in this game The difference in breeds their stamina health coats Turkoman always my favourite one in story and Missouri Fox Trotter in RDRonline for his speed If they ever plan on adding more horses I d be so happy or even possibly own more than 5 To have a ranch maybe would seem as fine new business since we got a moonshine business as well The animation of horses and their behaviour is spectacular Do you fight a lot and prefer horses that won t buck you off when the first bullet flies by Go for Turkoman or Andalusian Need a fast friend Arabian not a big fan of those They re skittish Oh man I could talk about this game all day
Oh I almost forgot YOU MICAH

RDR 2 Story 11 10
RDR online 5 10
Honestly I never ever thought that a Red Dead Redemption game would ever come to PC I had hoped the first one would but this is even better
Got into a shooting competition with some random dude Couldn t hit the targets so I shot the dude instead 10 10
I love this game I mean really LOVE it Only problem I am having is people hacking and ruining the game Rockstar needs to seriously start cleaning up the game asap It is tons of fun but when people are teleporting around events and not being able to damage them at all with every bullet you put into their skull to just standing in your camp and being blown up and thrown into the air so high you insta die when you land its getting harder and harder to enjoy the game reminds me of GTA all over again great game when people play legit
After some testing I was able to get the game working if I disabled my Asus Raid DLX soundcard software After doing that the game now loads and works well
old review
As with what seems like a ton of other people I can t launch the game it seems the rockstar launcher wants me to buy it again This is a piss poor release that they have successfully botched up twice a new record for amateurism
Hello dear friends
After playing Rockstar s latest product for 53 hours I have to say that we are on the side of one of the best games of this generation in the computer game industry This game is highly eventful and high quality and has multi layered dimensions of art music design Lighting high quality animations and many other things One of the story stages of the game and the sub stages and various activities in this game is made with arithmetic and accuracy and thinking The wildlife of this game is as much as 10 story games It has a wide range and can be one of the important factors in the quality of this game The story of the game in the stages along with the epic and listening music will delight you The game world is very carefully and realistically designed and for each behavior You will answer For example if you hold a gun and look around the city people will tell you that you don t need to use a gun or if you harass a town butcher or a gun dealer or discover their secret the next time See them they ll tell you you came back And I have nothing to hide or they say you bothered me a lot last time and things like that There is a lot in the game from finding hidden gold bars or treasure trove of criminal gangs and stealing horses and carriages and selling them and hunting legendary animals and turning them into special clothes Your popularity line in the game It plays an important role and makes people treat you well or get into fights with you Your weapons get dirty over time and you need to clean them to get them back to their original strength Taming horses in the game is one of the most enjoyable activities of the game Arthur has the ability to personalize everything from clothes to weapons The artistic design and graphics of the game are excellently designed and make you wait from time to time and take photos Take it and the photo mode of the game is also great The release of this game for personal computers initially had problems but after various updates published by Rockstar it was completely solved but the system is still there It requires a strong compiler to play Anyone who wants to understand the grandeur and breadth and depth of the game must experience it and the origins of the game in the story section That s the decent thing to do and it should end there
EDIT GUYS I FIXED GAME NOT STARTING ISSUE UNPLUG YOUR CONTROLLER BEFORE LAUNCHING GAME
I cannot Play this game There are no guides online that enable me to play this
Cried because i ve been waiting a year to be a cowboy and still can t be one
I will change this review if they fix the game just enough so that I can actually launch the dang thing
Well The game itself needs no description It s a masterpiece and everyone knows that
Fortunately despite all the negative reviews the game runs pretty smooth for me So as i have not faced any problems in the game i highly recommend buying it
After all it s Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC
I play primarily niche indie games and rarely ever give AAA games a glance never cared much about any of Rockstar s other games even though I knew they were committed to quality however there was always something special and unique about the Red Dead series especially since there are so few western games out there I know it s been said by a thousand critics but yeah this game really is a masterpiece It s truly a marvel that so many people from all over the world were able to focus on this project and pull it off flawlessly The first thing everyone notices are the spectacular and life like graphics but every single aspect of the game is close to perfection animations physics music characters it all comes together and makes for an amazing experience I can t see myself playing too many other games for quite awhile Absolutely worth full price the wealth of content and overall quality are more than worth it
A real living breathing world One of if not the most immersive game worlds ever created though it is a very slow game because its almost like being there in the old west for real Some may like that others may love the immersion
It has some of the most realistic NPCs with actual AI that works which seems rare for games of today You can even talk to every NPC and there is a lot of interaction
It also has while small considering its the old west the most immersive towns and cities for the time period ever created in a game The towns are amazing and never have I seen such amazing detail with so much interaction realism and actual npcs that look like they belong there in towns cities that know how to move out of your way than I have this game
Definitely highly recommended if you are looking for a highly immersive slow paced game where you can actually feel like you are really living in the old west
Literally the best game i have ever played 10 10
10 Requested a Refund on steam
This game is genuinely fantastic as i have played it on console before but due to a very bad pc experience just from installing it i cant recommend it
so months later i decided to give it a go again bought the game took a few hours to install and once again the social club wasn t letting me get on the game i had a little more determination this time and i suppose since there has been a good 6 7 months since i first bought it and made this review i managed to find a solution to my problem
DELETE YOUR ROCKSTAR GAMES ONE DRIVE FILES
i have no idea why but previously downloaded files seems to interfere with the newly downloaded ones either way i got to play red dead on PC
10 10 Excellent game P
This game saved my life
My ex wife and I have a daughter together and adopted our son together They are now both 4 years old
When we were going through our separation I found myself lost and miserable I was self destructive I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand my working hand my games hand the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with the hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide
After learning of the severity of my self inflicted damage I was borderline suicidal Keep in mind that just a few months before this I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety I have never had fits of rage or been one to break down and cry but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side
Having nothing better to do I searched for a game I could play ONE HANDED while I recovered I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews I decided that it had to be worth a shot I must admit I didn t beat the game or play nearly as long as some of you In fact I may have only played this game a day or two With that being said after doing so I had a new found joy and hope for life I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness I was able to see the fruits of my labor I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay
After coming to that realization I turned the game off and I went back to work It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself and I became the father I needed to be in that moment not the weak boy I was behaving as
Today I am close friend with my kids mother We don t fight or argue or say hurtful things to each other We are parents and friends
I now have 3 kids My third child is wait for it also 4 years old The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly We have been in a relationship for a year now and are very happy together
Moral of the story you never know what life holds in store for you and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me I wouldn t be where I am today This silly little game helped me realize that
Thank you Red Dead Redemption 2
The audio is really well made I love the sounds that are in the game there is not much to say since the sounds are prefect
Now the difficulty is another thing The game overall was pretty difficult the most difficult part was the missions but I m pretty sure every rockstar game is difficult when playing for the first time When replaying the mission it isn t as difficult then It s mostly hard to learn at first but then after a few times of replaying the mission it s pretty easy to master
Bugs destroy the game
You can use them for speedrun
Nothing encountered
There are quite a few bugs that i have experienced like the character dissapearing meaning i would have to restart the game and the preformance being really bad at times But i think they have fixed those bugs already Otherwise the bugs aren t really so game breaking
There is none
The story was probably one of the best stories i have experienced in any game The story is just so overwhelmingly good that i think it would still be fun to play the story over again a hundred times The story has so many unexpected events which makes the player go really amazed and so many fun and intressting missions Although the epilouge was a bit boring the story was fully okay
The gameplay section has kinda the same points i made in the Story section and the Difficulty section but one thing i didn t mention is that there are still a lot of things to do even after fully completing the story like completing the game to 100 there is also the Red Dead Online which is the multiplayer version of Red Dead Redemption 2 There is also a story in multiplayer like the singleplayer one there are a lot of things to do in multiplayer like the stranger mission or fully completing the roles etc
Really short 0 3 hours
Short 4 8 hours
Few hours 10 20 hours
Long 40 60 hours
Very Long 61 100 hours
Extremely Long 101 hours
The game lenght is really long you could also just say that it never ends since you can still play after the story mission but it isn t as fun as doing the story mission though There is also Red Dead Online but i think only the story counts as the game lenght If Red Dead Online counts then it would easily be put in the Extremely Long thing
Refund it if you can
Now taking everything i said right now about the game i think it s worth the whole 59 99 euros that it s priced on Although you can get the game for a bit cheaper during sales if you think the price is too high
A narrative tour de force
