Nothing less can be said to describe this almost 100 hour long journey that will take you through the towns and lands of a shifting America at the turn of the XX century following the story of Arthur Morgan and a whole bunch of misfits and weird characters in a world that s getting less and less hospitable for their kind The twists and turns of the plot the extremely variegate and believable cast whose stories you ll get to know care for and be a part of the top notch writing and a soundtrack that is nothing short of amazing starring some of the finest artists in American alt country and soul music make this one of the highest point in video games storytelling and probably one of the greatest Western stories ever told
The gameplay side of the production is an acquired taste it s pretty well known that the game is very slow and moving around feels kinda heavy but it s also very functional to the game world and once you gets used to it you will not want it any other way and if you do well maybe this game is not the one for you and there s nothing wrong with that The amount of activities to do and stuff to see is pretty amazing and if you enjoy them all they will make the game even longer
On the technical side the game will probably require a bit of tinkering on your part in order to make it run properly on your system I had to spend almost two hours adjusting visual settings so it could finally reach relatively solid 60 fps in every situation on my system currently mounting a GTX 1070 and a i5 6600k CPU achieving that with a combination of mostly Ultra and High settings with a few Medium ones The mandatory Rockstar Launcher is definitely an unnecessary hassle we really could have done without let s just hope it won t break the game in the future like GFWL did with GTA IV
I haven t tried the Online mode yet so I cannot comment on that
In the end Red Dead Redemption II is likely a game that won t please everyone but those who ll dive deep into its rich world won t find anything like it
RDR2 has one of the most beautiful worlds with untouched nature reserves and innumerable interesting locations worth seeing
For example I took the opportunity to view the world in VR via VorpX which was breathtaking in RDR2

Red Dead Redemption 2 is Masterpiece

Pleasant atmosphere
Music and sound are good
I play the game on 1080p resolution but with medium low settings because my pc is a bit old
This is my PC in case you ask me

GeForce GTX 660 Gigabyte OC 3GB Edition
10 10 Must Play
Red Dead Redemption 2 offers the best wild west experience I recommend you play it
Ok I probably should wait to write review because I was one of the suckers apparently that paid full price for the game and then it goes on a 20 percent discount less than two weeks later Stupid marketing moves like that do nothing but pissoff loyal customers and will no doubt gonna back fire on Valve in the long run At the least will certainly delay revenue for Steam as we learn to wait and not jump right at release Lesson learned Valve Gosh I feel much better now getting that off my chest lol Anyway back to the game
First off the game is fun Good story action and characters It s pretty easy to fall in love with this game The scenery is very detailed and the voice actors are awesome You can almost feel the cold and freeze attacking you when in snow and mountains areas The certain gritty aspect of the old west and voice accents just add to the experience The story is solid although it is quite easy to get off track with side quests which is pretty cool too And the story keeps you interested and immersed Besides who doesn t like to brandish a nice six shooter anyway
That said I think it is crazy that as a fix to starting the game for so many me included is to unplug your controller before launching it I mean ok that works But why should we have to do that for a game that costs almost 60 USD whoops I mean 47 for all the wise and smart people that waited a bit to buy it I would think devs would have that worked out but hey at least it will launch most times doing it that way The only other negative I can think of is that occasionally the game will crash on me This does not happen very often and there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why However No problem just unplug your controller and fire that baby up again and turn on the controller and you re good to go for another run
Would I buy this game again Absolutely However I did learn a lesson for me to slow down and set a spell like a couple of weeks to get in on a deal Why pay more than ya have to That said I think the game it worth the money even at full price in spite of the loading issue and occasional crashing And you will probably experience may hours of awesome fun playing this game And now for me it s back to running from the law and chasing outlaws Enjoy
No Oppressor Mk II feelsamazing that s how a R game should be

There isn t much more I can say about this game that has not been said before amazingly well written story Fantastic graphics great songs
Online experience
You have been disconnected from Red Dead Online due to a fault on Rockstar game services Error 0x20010006
As if rockstar want to say That s the way it is

Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the best if not the best game I ve ever played Hands down The open world is stunning and inviting the story is captivating and addictive the characters are lovable and interesting and the combat is satisfying and entrancing Sure the controls and some of the missions aren t perfect but the game s positives far outweigh the negatives
This is one of those games that are genuinely worth their high Triple A price tag so if you re in the market for a long game that you can sink hours and hours into with an amazing story then look no further than Red Dead Redemption 2
You re a cowboy who can root toot and shoot what more do you want
The game is fantastic but
1 You can t add the game to your Rockstar library I don t know why xD you need to lunch the game from steam every time
2 Rockstar servers is sh t in every game they own it
3 It s really hard to get gold in the game
4 Graphic 10 10 they make every details so good
5 Reality 10 10
6 Sound track 10 10
7 Open world is really amazing you can do anything you imagine and people there are so friendly
8 Story mode is fantastic
If you like your grandpa story you should buy this game
Ladies and gentlemen it is challenging to decide where to begin with concerning this game The technical sector is outstanding and the graphics on my rig at least unfold the admirable world of the Wild West which is hands down one of the most impressive i have ever seen only compared with the world of GTAV which happens to belong to Rockstar as well Additionally all the landscapes you will see are a beauty and many times you ll just want to run with your horse around to enjoy the view Moreover as far as the story is concerned i couldn t help but develop a bond with certain characters I don t think you can avoid getting absorbed by their adventures and you will definitely feel touched by certain events and situations We are talking about a title which was made with pure craftsmanship destined to maintain your interest till the very ending When i reached the credits it was like i had to say goodbye to a dear friend There is no doubt in my mind it will be a long time before we witness a game that offers an incredible abundance of intense feelings like RDR2 Just go buy this unique masterpiece
I got around to finishing the game I will say the story is amazing It made me enjoy watching the group at the beginning and see how happy they are and how the interact and then it slowly falls as story progresses Now we have Dutch shouting at Arthur s ear going ONE MOAR SCORE and WE NEEED DEH MONIAH
My god Dutch how far you fallen down by having that stinkin earwig weasel its way into your ear and lay lies
Now I will say the game has a bit of issues as for me and that was game crashes I would just randomly have my game just crash out of nowhere I did notice a lot of mixed reviews and I understand where they are coming from but putting them aside I can say that the game is fully worth purchasing as it has the most interesting story progression so far for me It got me hooked since I started playing and I couldn t put it down

I played a beautiful game with a wonderful story memorable soundtracks realistic visuals atmospheric huge open world and full of attractive experiences they would not be able to get any idea of that game at all You would have to say to them I played a game that metascore 93 PS XB 97 Then they would exclaim Oh what a fantastic game that is
Anyway
Words can t even describe enough how wonderful this is
But numbers can
10 10
Very good game it was really fun I love the story and side quests but I would have liked a better ending although that is not possible because of the first Red Dead Redemption game
I definitely recommend it D
It is fun to play online with friends but unfortunately there is far too little to do And everything important costs gold Gold that you can t get without playing forever or spending real money
At least there are Twitch Prime Drops which you should definitely get if you have Twitch Prime
OMG It will only launch w o controller Once launched add the controller and it works This game is much better on the PC than on the X Box and it is terrific I just wish I had more control over the save game
LENNY MY BOY
Seriously though great game
First i have to start by saying that this game is a masterpiece This is the first game i have taken 100 screenshots in the first 10 hours of the game
Playing as Arthur was the best thing in a game because he is one of the best protagonist i have played as
The animations and the voice actors just fit so good one with each other This is the first game in a long time that made me do every possible mission The side quests are so well done Some of them change some things in the story mode
Red Dead Redemption 2 is the prequel of the first Red Dead Redemption and it s a good this cause we finally saw what happened to the gang that John was in And now a lot of things make more sense in the first one
Red Dead Online it s a prequel of a prequel it s really weird Online it s not bad but it s hard for new players to make the gold and money And it needs some heists robberies but other then that it s good
The graphics and visuals of the game are astonishing and really well made
The gameplay it s just so good like no other game
The soundtrack just amazing and really well fitted A really great choice with the western like vibe of the music and game
I fell in love with the game in the first 2 hours of it because it s just so good
I played like 10 12 hours per day cause it s great No game really made me do that That s how much i love it I don t regret buying this game I bought it on sale for 40 euros The best decision The game is worth every penny you have I hope they will port Red Dead Redemption to pc so i can play it or maybe a remake or remastered version of it and maybe Undead Nightmare 1 2
So if you have the money buy the game it s worth it
If you want to look at the screenshots that i have some are spoilers so be carefull

In my review I will focus on Single Player because I didn t play Multiplayer I finished my game on 93 which took me more than 200 250 hrs played on Rockstart launcher
I think that RDR2 story is the most epic story I ever played I really enjoyed most of the missions I didn t even feel like there were some kind of filler missions which didn t have any impact on the main story or character development
I really like how they were able to create such unique gang characters I played a lot of games in my life but I never cared that much about other main characters in the game until I played RDR2 This game really made me care for other characters Every single character felt unique and through the story you learned even more about these characters
Amazing combat Shooting is really feels real Reloading etc is realistically correct which is amazing Dead Eye ability is really neat and with options to upgrade it with talismans etc Melee combat is also good
Wow I must say that RDR2 is my the most favorite open world game I played in A REALLY LONG TIME I don t even remember the last time I just went to the woods and enjoy the world by hunting or just chilling RDR2 really nailed the world
Horse physic is really great and on spot I like that there are different types of horses and bond system is really cool as well
Map is HUGE and BEAUTIFUL I never used fast travel in my whole play through Every time my ride felt unique with so many random events Even in the very end of the game I still experienced NEW random events Did I mention that you can hunt in the game And that animals are very real I spent a lot of hrs by just hunting
Yes it s true that RDR2 has a really bad performance but sadly it s mainly because of Rockstar Launcher and too strong protection but otherwise game is really beautiful You have a tons of settings you can change Overall quality of textures looks really good
RDR2 is one of my most favorite games I ever played Story was amazing Arthur Morgan is the most realistic in game character I ever played as Thanks a lot Rockstar for creating this masterpiece Even if you heard that Multiplayer is bad you should really try it at least for Single Player because it s really worthy
Arthur Morgan
Product is not refunded I own it on Steam as well it s just a bug
You get high honor for killing klansmen so thats pretty rad
RDR2 is a near masterpiece of a story driven game and RDO is a deeply flawed but enjoyable experience
There are a lot of complaints I could make mostly about the online mode but I ve played over 1000 hours and anything too harsh would ring hollow
There are a few things you still need to know and the short version is this
Both Red Dead Online and GTA Online have a huge problem with hackers If you find yourself in a server with one in RDO they can siphon away your character s money they can teleport you into the sky they can blow you up repeatedly they can trap you in cages they can fly they can set you on fire and I could go on
In addition the Online community just got over a 7 month content drought and many of us had given up on receiving any more updates The update happened right when the community was reaching a point of mass protest and it turns out that Rockstar has plans for at least one more update around Halloween
The game is worth its price tag for the single player alone and I ve personally clocked much more time online than I have in the Story mode Even with all its warts Red Dead Online is a lot of fun Just know what you re getting into
Update Rockstar fixed their game is as good as everyone and their grandpa says
Crashed my computer on game launch none of the known fixes worked refunded until Rockstar gets their crap together
Thank you Arthur and thank you R for making a masterpiece of a game
Pros Everything in the game is good
Cons R Server kicks you out

Red Dead Redemption 2 stands shoulder to shoulder with Grand Theft Auto V as one of the greatest games of the modern age It s a gorgeous depiction of an ugly period that s patient polished and a huge amount of fun to play and it s combined with Rockstar s best storytelling to date This is a game of rare quality a meticulously polished open world ode to the outlaw era Looking for one of this generation s very best single player action experiences Here s your huckleberry
Ridin ma horse Slappin some hoes Eat n some beans Shoot n some greens
Now I ain t some lilly livered grrehorn overwhelmed with the simplest notion of the loss of my humanity
Ride hard Play hard Be hard That s mw m Pa used to say in the bottom of the bottle
10 10 would ride the wilds with my horse again
Two years late to the party but still glad I got around this one
While Manhunt will still be my guilty pleasure RDR2 is probably a top favorite from Rockstar Games
RDR2 tells the downfall the infamous Van der Linde gang before the first game from the perspective of Arthur Morgan the top gunman His entire arc is the things of beauty and to say doubting I d like him as much as John was foolish of me He is a character full of likeable traits who can stand proudly amongst my favorites Robert Clarke deserved every single praise he recived alongside the rest of the cast with especially Benjamin Davis stealing every single scene he shows up
Now RDR was almost entirely a love letter to the Italian Western with mostly deserted and dry locations and people However 2 goes beyond to cover more classic takes too If you have enjoyed any of the tales of the western genre you will absolutely be satisfied in some way From small to large heists insane shoot outs in towns and barfights mountains to deserts forrests to dirty swamps every single activity in the savage times you could like from the West is here The soft harmonic guitars gospel chanting gorgeous visuals and beautiful vistas just deserve that you to take your time and enjoy a slow horseback ride
Everything you do in the world comes to bite your bottom eventually Being a carcass to people will not result in kindness the lawmen are ruthless to hunt you down meanwhile bounty hunters and rival gangs seek to ambush you at any turn Exploring the enviorment paying attention to the sorroundings and finding side missions and quests always benefits you from some good looting rare materials to sell or craft maybe simply amusing characters that go about their antics The hours I spent just taking a break to go about my leaisure is probably half my playtime
Hunting alone is a good example of how much you can go by hunt to eat in a makeshift camp donate to the gang sell for profit use to craft There is almost nothing you do that can be considered a waste and letting loose to invest yourself in the people and especially your trusted horse will always be worth it
I ll be straightfoward however This is a slow game So slow that I wouldn t blame you for getting tired of it by the first hours
In gameplay terms we have a similar mannerism to Max Payne 3 the shooting mechanics being deliciously brutal and combat as a whole feels impactful as it should You must keep your body well with some light rpg style mechanics and the game will not be afraid to pull a rabbit with a gun if you do not watch your back Being able to gunfight in first person is a neat addition not too good for the rest
As a whole I cant deny I am biased for adoring the genre this game pays so much homage and respect to but in it s own it s a fantastic story of it s own that does everything to immerse you in
If you liked Clint Eastwood or John Wayne s movies if you don t please get out of my sight and leave your testicles by the door you enjoy a slower approach to open world and can put up mindly annoying design choices for sake of a plot I can absolutely recommend RDR2 even at full price and on sale it s damn worth the price
Red Dead Redemption 2 is hands down one of the most beautiful and gripping games to come out of Rockstar I have not played Read Dead 1 but that was no detriment to the story in my mind it almost enhanced it as I couldn t fully predict how the story would twist turn and eventually end A slightly dodgy port is eclipsed by the masterful story telling and cinematic missions that far outshines GTA V another Rockstar game in recent memory Online mode is a stinking pile of garbage not surprising honestly but story mode has more than enough to justify a purchase at AAA price for a gold standard of a game
