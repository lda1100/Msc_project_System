After level 30 need to pay real money for avoid PvP
I d rather wait New World released on 28 September
Never played a game where you pay real money per hour to have no PvP
Forced PVP after lvl 30 you can toggle off pvp but this only makes it so YOU cant attack others but others can still attack you
Pay 2 Win
Same Developer as Bless online although they attempted to confuse people with a studio name change same people
Also if you post information about the game that is not an attack but just information about the game that shows some of the negatives they will attempt to get your profile on steam perma banned from all community activity across the entire platform That is not professional
Pay to win game from the same scum that released Bless Online then pulled it off Steam
Perma ban you from discussions if you make people aware of this
DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM
To be clear you need to know where are we sitting at this moment

So like you see this time Round 8 Studio by NEOWIZ yes by NEOWIZ thats the full name of this studio you can check registering documents uncle google will show you easly everything about it provided us another version of this fantastic IP called Bless No joke i really liked Bless Online round 5 As someone who played Bless Online for over 700 hrs now after 18 hrs in this version i can say a few words
6 points max
1 Graphics 4 6 nothing special good enough for an MMORPG
2 Music 3 6 well its not Mr Hanz Zimmer like it was in Bless Online but music in this one exists
3 SFX 3 6 common like in most asian games
4 Optimization 2 6 its better than it was in Bless Online but still not good enough Like seriously I need to go to Low settings to play on GTX1080 or RX580 or even GTX 1060 This game has just ok graphics nothing uncommon After all those years rounds after changing engine to UE4 you still haven t learn how to use this engines Have you seen Lost Ark Its Unreal Engine 3 Heck even Elyon on UE3 work way better than this version of Bless on UE4 Shame NEOWIZ shame
About memory leaks In Bless Online round 5 i was forced to restart game every 2 3 hrs because of memory leaks But here in Bless Unleashed after 18 hrs of playtime i havent seen any significant memory leaks PC game discord is using between 6 and 10 GB of ram Most of the time around 8 GB
5 UI 2 6 just a port from consoles clunky a bit annoying but we can ignore this one game has other major issuess At least they fixed using mounts you can almost normally using mounts
6 Combat it could be good but with tab tracked target it is so bad its crazy bad In situations like oh sh t run run run you cannot run away because tab track function auto rotating your toon towards targeted enemy And without using tab track function your skills with long animations it means most of them wont hit and you will miss
7 P2W elements 6 6 quite heavy so max 6 points its some good place for Whales and Visa Mastercard Knghts and Real Life Losers
I stopped playing Bless Online round 5 when they started adding p2w sh t to cash shop
Here we have just got p2w from the very beginning So no surprise you know where you putting your mace in
8 Gameplay i like it it reminds me Bless Online very similar identical or almost identical locations this combat is not bad like i said before it just needs some work Beut hey forget it Not gonnas happen This company wont fix anything This game is just port from consoles they didnt fix it on consoles they wont here
Will i recommend this game
If you badly want to try yes its free check it yourself and make your own opinion
But remember dont waste any single cent on this game It is not worth really Honestly dont do this
And you NEOWIZ honestly shame shame shame
You think you can move some guys to another room put some sticker on doors with name Round 8 Studio and you think youre safe or what Its still you the same dubious quality greedy company
You think all people are stupid and throw their hard earned cash to you You think all gamers are stupid Or blind because they love MMO RPG genre so they wish to sink in some new world of MMORPG
Not gonna happen Not with this game Not under your developing and publishing
Seriously NEOWIZ you are one of the worst gaming companies at least on the Planet Earth
So cya later in Round 9
PS All above is my humble opinion
Edit Sorry for any possible typos misspelling
Apologies if this is a bit long but I just want to get my point across
A lot of people are writing negative opinions with very little clarity Please let me explain my situation as someone that has played all the versions of Bless that have been released so far Online Unleashed Mobile I have very little issues with the current state of Unleashed It is a competent free to play Korean MMORPG However the business practices of the parent company mean you need to avoid this game
From my understanding Bless was originally announced in 2011 as a Unreal 3 RPG When it eventually got released in regions Korea Russia Japan and the West NA EU it failed immensely So much so that it got repeated re releases in some regions and was shut down on Steam in under 18 months
This company only cares about one thing Making as much money as quickly as possible This should not be a surprise since Neowiz in mainly a mobile developer Somehow in the early 2010s they obtained about 50m million to make a PC MMORPG That project failed immensely and since then they have been whoring out the assets as much as possible to try make a return
Firstly the main versions of Bless Online Korea Japan Russia then the West
Secondly Bless Mobile the first mobile game that is about to shut in Korea after 18 months outsourced to Joycity
Thirdly The console version of Bless Unleashed published by Bandai Namco which served as an inferior Beta version that will be released on PC
Fourthly THE PC Version of Bless Unleashed self published by Neowiz similar to Bless Online after it was dropped by Aeria Games in 2017 which is a cheap port that they couldn t even be bothered to fix the UI UX problems brought over from console
Fifthly A SECOND mobile game is being developed in China by a company called Dragon Quest Games that will launch soon after this game
Neowiz are only in this for a return on investment i e to make money for a stupid investment a decade ago that is still costing them MMO players put money into games expecting that they are a worthwhile investment Bless is the antithesis of this and will probably shut down in the next 1 2 years
I have not even mentioned the aggressive cashshop the tons of assets reused from Bless Online or the even more content that is missing that they will push through in future as part of future updates
Do not give this company a cent they are scam artists that probably bribed Park Geun hye and that s the only reason they were never brought to court
After level 30 its forced PvP only There is a toggle where YOU can t PvP except others can still PvP you Except you can pay 2 dollars an hour to have PvP be off paying to have no PvP HAHAHAHA
And yes I play BDO which has PvP forced to be on Except there is no cash shop item to remove PvP and the death for PvP is annoyance nothing serious The world is massive zones in this game are crowded and small so PvP is extremely rare to begin with
Never played a game where you pay real money per hour to have no PvP
update
Since I don t want to install the game again to take a screenshot
and the console version has same item
and their official twitter status
Game play
Community
Dev team negative
game play is fun to me
community is just a bunch of Brazilians spamming global English because they can t get their own server
posting this as a do not recommend because I got banned from the discord for simply asking for help with the support team with maybe opening up a path to refunding my old bless online founders pack since neowiz is unresponsive to emails and bless studios doesn t even exist anymore Dev team is a bunch of immature babies I ll delete this review if I could just get a helpful response from the support team or anyone
DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME SINCE THE SUPPORT TEAM WILL JUST TURN YOU AWAY IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES
The Backstory of Bless Unleashed
Bless Online launched from South Korea to every region and miserably failed in every single one
Launched in the West It was open for some months
And Steam had to offer universal refunds for everybody regardless of play time because the game was so broken
Item duplication and every kind of bugs were still present in the Western release which were reported in the Korean BETA YEARS AGO
Promising beginning of a story
Bless Unleashed is as PAY TO WIN as pay to win can get
You can literally buy currency which is used to buy gear
Every kind of boosters you can imagine etc
The combat system is worse than a 2010 era game It s shallow clunky and boring
I have only one advice
Do not invest time in this GAME It will be shut down in WEEKS
Horrible optimized instance based with in shop items that literally boosts your characters stats to give you the upper hand I am not kidding You can literally buy attack speed potions in the store Further more it seems like it s forced PvP and guess what In order to opt out of PvP you can buy potions in the store that makes you none targetable for PvP for one hour And to top it off you can buy storage expansions Horrible in game shop horrible otimazation horrible instance based mechanics horrible game Stay as far away from this as possible
I ve been waiting for some time for this game to release on PC and get a chance to give it a go being starved for MMOs for quite some time Having no prior Bless game related knowledge and didn t read about anything related to the game to keep it fresh when it launches I played it until I realized I am not getting enjoyment in it s current state
General feel It s an unfinished console port the UI is a mess to navigate or use terrible user experience browsing the menus The game runs fine on my high end rig and looks nice but the controls are attrocious
Crafting I quickly realized that simply gathering materials in order to craft is the most tedious thing in existence It is impossible read as a complete waste of time to keep crafting in line with leveling Best to keep it for max level and simply ignore gathering nodes The first items you can craft are easy to make but they are objectively useless as well You quickly unlock decent decent gear but it requires you to defeat world bosses or elite enemies for the materials You need 1 material per craft the item is not 100 drop chance i had to defeat 6 elites to get a damn material from the grassland ogre fights are long and sometimes the respawn timer iis attrocious You can use Z to swap channels and find a zone that has it spawned kill it get 0 useful loot and repeat All of this in my attempt to reach crafting level 5 to make some decent armors or weapons Of course you can craft the lowest tier item for xp which doesn t need boss items but the gathering is also plagued by low drop chances It s pretty clear it was made as an awful grind just ignore it altogether you get better rewards from following the main quest or grind the 2p 5p dungeons The effort and time that is to be spent on crafting simply doesn t cover the leveling speed
Gathering plants ores trees are plentiful Skins cloths nope They are drops about 1 6 drop rate per mob on average Same as boss materials Rare materials are even rarer of course Now I wouldn t mind working for my crafting skillups but after 30 minutes of extensive gathering for skins and cloths I managed to create 3 items Because you need 10 per craft That means either gather 10 nodes 1 per node or kill 50 mobs For just 1 item that is almost worthless just to grind that skill up a bit
Economy gold is plentiful and as useless as well The real currency is Star Seeds which you can buy from the shop daily exchange gold star seed with a very low cap but it gets higher for higher level characters This currency is used at the auction house market to buy from other players or for selling items you can get this one So with a few hundred bucks you ll be able to fully deck a character later down the line then complain there is no content
Combat no animation cancelling no ability queuing very long animations in general All 3 of them together combined go captain planet result in combat that looks good but feels clunky I played Ranger which is a very good overall class but the amount of times dodging pressing V to full charge attacks trying to chug a potion or cast an AoE skill and not registering even though it felt natural in the flow of combat to be able to do these actions is high Or the amount of times I fire 1 2 extra shots after the mob is already dead same high You have to wait between 1 or 2 seconds between attacks to properly play Not reactive enough for my taste and it feels super slow
Inventory easy to manage at first but quickly becomes item hell You can loot treasure chests in the world then redeem for 1 bag space I love this mechanic but the amount of items you get once you pass level 10 keeps exploding Repeateble quest items for reputation materials for all crafting items for the blessings of all other classes potions 50 types of food augment runes and the list goes on It looks like you won t be able to fully enjoy the game without buying some item slots of going multi account The warehouse bank storage is abysmal You can t craft or turn in quest items with said items in the bank Just one word hell to manage
Group content took me a while to realize Matchmaking can be used for 2p or 5p dungeon runs I enjoyed them Combat is fun encounters are engaging loot at the end so so If you want a weapon because it s an upgrade prepare to do some runs many depending on your luck For me it was easier to grind bosses and materials and craft myself the upgrades and I didn t enjoy it I felt tired after finally getting decent weapons not excited
Quests generic and simple Rarely some more engaging fun the Bard one is my favorite as it s super cute Make sure you do side quests otherwise you are getting left out
Open World this is a bit in between let me segregate it into 2 parts
