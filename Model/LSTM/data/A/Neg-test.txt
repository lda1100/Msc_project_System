Open World PvE anything but end game zones pure PvE Lots of activities resetting quests elites raid bosses The map is constantly overflowing with activity I felt like in RIFT where every zone had something for me to do 24 7 and I love it However you don t scale down in terms of power or rewards so level 5 world bosses quickly become worth 0 interest for you as a high level RIFT solved that through scaling and everyone could get decent rewards for their current progression by using currenices but here nope You can go back and help the newbies but you won t be getting much in return just fun but after 10 kills that dissipates as well
Open world PvP end zones you are always killable by other players You can purchase PvP immunity scrolls so you can PvE freely but it gets expensive FAAAST If you don t like getting ganked and are a PvE carebear you won t have a great time If you like PvPing and or being a jerk in general you will have fun until everybody quits Standard Open world PvP with mandatory flagging with some fame notoriety basic system that doesn t do that much
Real money shop it has 10 tabs I guess I shouldn t go further Boosters on top of boosters packs limited deals cosmetics which are out of the fantasy world and plenty of gacha that don t even give you stuff you are interested in As a Ranger I got blessing soul fragments for all other classes BUT ranger I stopped after 5 draws The store in general pollutes your inventory with coupons I feel like I am going to Wallmart with a deck of 70 coupons that don t stack It s not even accessible You won t get many places with casual spending It s made for cash grabs whales targets and for people who are almost 24 7 online Standard f2p mobile game mechanics it has them all
So should you get it
Are you planning on casually doing the story without getting too involved Are you planning on playing this as a singleplayer experience and maybe with some Matchmaking in between just to see how the game fares Then YES it s free it has content you can easily burn 20 60 hours until the points form above start to kick in your teeth sooner or later depends on your personality
Are you looking for a long term investment expecting to have a good time at end game and have fun along the way playing the multitude of game systems and classes Then NO taking into consideration the bullet points above it will feel very painful
I was enjoying the game legitimately as a PVE player then suddenly theres a force pvp thats just sad
Dictator devs
I wouldn t recommend this games unless you have a fat wallet or some rich parents Game is 100 P2W That being said do you really want to spend money on a game that is going to be recycled over and over up to you
Took one look at the cash shop and noped out You can literally buy stat buffs for real money things like attack speed etc etc You can also buy pvp protection for 1 hour The game is already pay 2 win
Otherwise it s just another generic eastern MMO that you ve already played a billion times Priest Mage Ranger Zerker blah blah blah All the boring and generic classes are there There is nothing different about this game from the endless amounts of clones this copied from and will spawn
Just save your time and hard drive space there s nothing new to be seen here
I owned the 150 Bless Online pack and the Ultimate Bless Unleashed pack I can safely say that this game is better in terms of performance but a giant pile of
Estimated time of severs shutting down 1 Year
Place your bets
Weird how the top positive comments all have 20 hours in the game when it just released be careful with this one use it to spare some time while you wait for other games I advice against wasting money on packs they sound like a deal but it s like buying a costume for a monkey but you don t have a monkey waste of money
Average MMO with heavy P2W but there are some things I quite like
Best part is the combat very similar to Monster Hunter combat very different from all other MMOs with slow but satisfying hits while dodge rolling out of enemy hits
Worst part is the UI a console UI was left intact into the PC version and is an unintuitive mess after 15 hours of play im still fumbling into the menus
Overall I see no reason to play this game if you have another MMO you re having fun with considering the track record of this IP and the P2W endgame
BLESS Unleashed is a Massively Multiplayer Online RPG that is action based IE You aim with a crosshair or swing a sword with left mouse right mouse buttons Optimized for controller the game is still rather poorly optimized for Keyboard and Mouse despite all the fixes and changes made for release The game s menus are still horrible to navigate with a mouse as you are required to use a keyboard to go back a menu since you cannot click on a previous menu to go to another menu item There is still some significant menu lag here and there from time to time I also do NOT recommend setting graphics to Very Low as you will get super bright interiors for some reason
As a serious tip Disable Global chat by entering chat input Enter on keyboard and then pressing the O Key to change chat settings Scroll down to the Global row and change it to not show In addition make sure Language is set to Settings as by default it accepts all languages put into chat Once that s done save your options as they won t apply until you save This will immensely improve game play as you won t need to see chat scrolling a mile a minute
If you participated in the beta your rewards are located in the Premium Bag of your inventory ot the Lumina Lumera Shop The cash shop You accept the rewards and then use the consumables in your consumable tab of your bag to be granted their rewards Since mounts are account wide you do not get a second beta reward mount with each beta reward claim This is usually how you will get most promotional event items Mail can be accessed through special mail interaction points with an envelope symbol over them or where they are located on the map You have to still go to them physically on the map
Now I want to start my actual real opinions When I first started playing BLESS Unleashed during betas I was upset that Priest couldn t heal without getting specific Blessings unlocked through the use of certain memory fragments Well they decided that was a bad idea and gave their healing skills directly from what I ve seen so far pre level 30 via class level ups However as a balancing means for this they added a new gacha loot box system to the game to roll for upgrade materials on whatever Blessings you ve unlocked Players who use only Star Gems will be greeted with a 30 rolls per day limit via Star Seeds You require 1000 Star Seeds per roll You will usually need 3 5 of each breath to upgrade a single passive etc in a blessing And there are about 4 5 rows This is a bit daunting considering how Star Seeds work
Star Seeds are a special currency you can convert gold into but not back into gold that is primarily used for buying and selling on the Player Run markets Initially you can only excahnge 150 gold for 100 Star Seeds per day Yes per day You will get more exchanges not bigger exchange amounts from what I ve seen the higher level you are on a character Star Seeds are per character and not account wide like the cash shop currency is The problem with this system is that it takes a week to exchange enough star seeds to get one roll for one breath Yes one breath not multiple to upgrade your blessing passives as explained above What s worse is if you don t have high value items which is unlikely for at least 75 of users you won t be getting many star seeds
And that brings me to classes themselves Classes are race locked A Ippin those tiny player characters can play as a Crusader and Priest but not other classes A Warg can t play priest either Elves can play a mage but not priest and so forth Apparently from what I ve heard old versions of other regions of the game had elves be able to play more classes Which is pretty unacceptable that we don t get that here
Character creation is pretty good but the camera rotation on characters is terrible in the character creator it goes too fast most of the time and is locked to certain angles from what I can tell Character names can t have spaces in them nor special characters unlike some other older free to play games and it s generally hard to see eye customization on characters like elves and humans
In short BLESS Unleashed is a terrible and greedy game There is a lot I didn t cover in this review and I m not really willing to go over every little detail If you want to try it be my guest If you are capable of playing this game completely free to play I pity and feel sorry for you
if you have no life play this game
if you have no where to spend your money play this game
if you hate MMORPG play this game
if you want to find out how good your previous game is play this game
this game are straight trash it really waste your time come back you will understand why the review are like this
A 10 year old re re released game with clunky combat a boring armor system dated graphics and a P2W system that lets you spend real money for direct ingame advantages including buying money Chat is utterly full of russian non english spam with the rest being filled up by gold selling bots
The only reason to play this game is that it s Free to play so you can waste a few hours until something worth playing comes out If it cost money it would have been an instant refund
